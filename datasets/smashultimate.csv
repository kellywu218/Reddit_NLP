What character to main?,"I really like Fox and spent 20 hours trying to learn the mechanics but failed miserably whenever it came down to aerials. I am terrible with aerials and so I want to main a character that has many hit combos that doesn't necessarily depend on aerials.

New Smash character prediction,"So my theory is that when they announce the sequel to the Mario Rabbids game, which I believe is on its way (hopefully, I love that game) at the same time they will announce the new character Rabbid.

Changing rules mid battle in Quick play," I got paired with this Wario player on a 2 stock 5min omega stage battle. I lost and waited because I wanted a Rematch which he/she accepted. But then, it became a 3 stock 7 min fight on a ruins style stage.

 I wanna know how to change rules (and quite possibly change fighter too) while still fighting the same player 

I know its the same player because my eyes were fixed on the screen and I did not see  the player disconnect. It was still Wario, same fighting styles, same moves. Just suddenly different rules. This is how I know I'm not mistaken

So my question is how do I do this? I wanna be able to have rematches with some players under different fighters and rules",SmashBrosUltimate
Is there a trick to doing neutral air consistently?,Question says it all. I'm a noob to the game. I find it very hard to run forward and then jump into a neutral air and maintain momentum. I more often than not end up doing forward air by accident. I remapped my stick to tilts which made back tilts super easy so now I just have trouble with Nair. Any tips or tricks to help me practice?,SmashBrosUltimate
Tilt Stick or Smash Stick?,"I know that some people will instantly say that the tilt stick is better, but I'm asking from a certain standpoint.

My background: I only had my switch for 10 days now and haven't had a nintendo console since the Nintendo DS I like 10-11 years ago. I played the Xbox 360 afterwards and have had the PS4 for 2 years and mostly played with a nacon controller (it's very similar to the switch pro controller).

I haven't found a main yet, so it's not easy to say which stick setting is better.

My Problem: When I use Tilt Stick then I end up failing to do smash attacks resulting in me barely being able to finish opponents unless they're at like 150% (depending on the characters). However when I use Smash Stick I end up barely using tilt attacks. It's not like I can't hit tilts, but they just feel unintuitive so I end up barely using them, therefore making some characters I like (ie. Mewtwo) worse than they could be.

So with this background information what is better suited for me? Tilt or Smash Stick.
I've switched a couple of times but I'm never sure which is better suited for me.",SmashBrosUltimate

Choose My Smash Main!!!,"As everyone knows there are an incredibly wide range of characters with varying skill and abilities in this game. As with all these options it can certainly be difficult to decide who you should main. However this question is not completely random, as there are certain commonalities among the characters I enjoy. 

The characters I enjoy playing are Lucina, Cloud, Ganondorf, and Samus, but I just recently got the game and was wondering what similar character you think I may enjoy. (While I recently got the game, I have been playing it for a while with my friends) I do want to be able to take the character to its cap with my skill level, so I can go try hard when I play against people.

Thank you for your help.",SmashBrosUltimate
Looking for a secondary to balance out some matchups I struggle with.,"I main Mewtwo so I have trouble with (believe it or not) mostly heavies, specifically DDD, Ganon, Bowser and any Mac with a good read. Some more common competitive characters (roy, Greninja, peach) also give me trouble because I feel like I'm just too slow no matter good my punish game is and can't really land a kill quickly or reliably like they can.

Since I play a lot of friendlies with people I know, I have a few characters I play somewhat commonly  and was wondering what this sub recommends.

-pokemon trainer- haven't labbed ivy but I have watched some competitive play and consider my Squirtle and Charizard to be pretty good

-pichu- still learning down b combos and how to spike with it but this might still give me trouble with heavies 

-wario- would this give me issues if they counterpick to pika or another possibly difficult high tier mu? I've done wario-pika and wario-joker a lot and would actually prefer mewtwo. Also I am often too slow with waft combos, I can see when the placement is right but I can tell either it's not true or I was so slow with getting waft out that they escape what would clearly have been a true upair waft

-joker- we all know joker, but if you guys think this is a good option then I'm curious to hear how jokers adapt to projectile heavy characters like the links/such cause I'll pick him game 2 and then use counter too much and get punished. Will the fact that everyone in my area is super good with this matchup discourage me since I am not quite there yet?",SmashBrosUltimate

Frankenstein Character,"The idea is to create a Frankenstein character with the best move set possible. Let's a go!

General size, weight, &amp; movement

* Inkling - She's fast, mobile, smallish, somewhat floaty for combos, and has the best dash in the game

Specials

* Neutral - Duck Hunt (Trick Shot) - Duck Hunt is worthless without the can. This move is insane.
* Up - G&amp;W (Fire) - Up B OOS for dayyyz
* Down -  Hero (Menu) - This makes me hate my Frankenstein character but I think it's the right answer. It also gives me the upper hand against non-English speakers ( This is a poke at how stupid this move is. Hero should be illegal in major tournaments until this is fixed imo)
* Side -ROB (Arm Rotor) - And invincible reflector that kills and is nearly impossible to avoid off stage

Jab &amp; Tilts

* Jab - Zero Suite Samus - Frame 1 jab? Yes please!
* Up - King K Rool - Frame 5, kills, and covers platforms
* Down -  Lucina - Decent at poking shields and 2 framing. Would be especially useful for hitting the tin can in a fast, straight line
* Side - King K Rool - Due to bell armor it's essentially a frame 4 killing move.

Aerials

* Neutral - Palutena - Don't need an OOS option so this will do. It's got disjoints, huge hitboxes, pokes, and combos into itself as well as other aerials.
* Up - Palutena - Obvious choice imo
* Down - G&amp;W - The only choice since I'll be using G&amp;W's Up B OOS a lot
* Forward -  Lucina - I love me some disjoints
* Back - Palutena - Fast, kills, shield is invincible, and combos into itself

Smashes

* Up - Mario - Great anti-air, only 9 frame startup, head is intangible, and a killing OOS option if I don't need Up-B
* Down -  Ness - This also makes me hate this character but yo-yo at the ledge is too busted to not abuse
* Side - Little Mac - Super armor starts on frame 8... spot dodge to f smash let's gooo

Grab (includes tethering and z-attacks if applicable)

* Palutena - Great grab range, back throw kills, and since I'm using 3 of Palu's aerials this will be useful for combos.

DLC 5 Prediction?,"I have a prediction and I don't know whether anyone else had said this but - Freddy Fazbear/Animatronics 

Ok so one of the recent suspicions was deconfirmed because they had no game on the switch console and the main 4 FNAF games all came to switch recently which is also suspicious timing

Freddy's costumes could act in a way similar to Bowser Jr, being that each costume could be a different Animatronic - They are all similar sizes and all attack in the same way (Minus obvious ones such as Mangle or Golden Freddy) 

Final smash could be a number of things, the first I think of is throwing the opponent into an office chair and have all the animatronics in the costume choices jumpscare the opponent at the same time dealing a ton of damage all at once

Freddy stats could be decent too, Higher Attack and Defence (It's ana Animatronic capable of biting through a skull) but with lower speeds 

Finally I think that with FNAF being an Indie game series that is always looking for now opportunities and I think a deal with smash could be good for both Scott and Sakurai and while I know Scott does have plans for the series this is a huge opportunity with the greatest, most ambitious fighting game of the decade

Joker's most OP ability,"As a casual (by casual I mean non competitive player) joker main, I think rebels guard is the most OP move he's got. Yes arsene parry is very strong and can kill very early and so can Bair but...

1.Rebels guard reduces the damages taken by half making it a good counter against inklings 50% jab for example

2.It fills your meter extremely quickly with hard hitting opponent like ganon, filling it in on forward smash

3.This is its best use IMO, it negates all knockback.It saved me from so many f-smash fair or any high knockback moves that could have easily killed me.Its also great to get out of combos

unfortunately, it also has one big flaw, its got a lot of endlag. It makes it a bit more balanced, but off stage it is fairly safe to use.

I dont know why i wrote this, i just feel like no one is really talking about how good it is, maybe im wrong and its actually awful but it saved me many many more times than it got me killed.",SmashBrosUltimate

Lucas’ moves makes little sense,"This is just kinda satirical and not meant to be taken really seriously

In smash he uses PK Freeze, PK Fire, and PSI Magnet which are all things he actually can’t learn in Mother 3. More or less, it makes even less sense that they gave him PK Freeze instead of PK Flash because he can learn PK Flash in game

I think that to make Lucas a more cannon character they should’ve made his move set like this

PK Freeze -&gt; PK Flash
They could have PK Flash have less damage and move as fluently like PK Freeze does in game

PK Fire -&gt; PK Love
I’m not entirely sure how they could animate this but seeing as it’s primarily a hexagon type shape they could make it a hexagon instead of a bolt that glows light blue 

PSI Magnet -&gt; PSI Shield or Counter
PSI Shield would just split any damage you take in half or work like an extra shield similar to Pit
Counter could work as other counters of the game

I was wondering if it is possible to change the player slot I am at will. I know that there's a way to do it with other controllers, but I am limited on controllers (to three total), and I don't have amiibos.",SmashBrosUltimate
Hori Battle Pad Pro,"Hi! I recently got a [Hori Battle Pad Pro](https://www.amazon.ca/Nintendo-GameCube-Controller-Officially-Licensed/dp/B01AD478L6)

I was wondering what people thought about it/experienced themselves with it? 

I have an original GameCube controller and I loved the Battle Pads new trigger buttons for jumping (I normally mapped jump onto z)

It feels a bit off but I’m not sure if that is just cuz I’m not used to the slight shape differences of the controller but I’ve also heard that there was weird control stick calibration on it? 

Should I stick with it or go back to my GameCube controller?

Is my GSP inflated or normal?,"Hello friends. I got the game about 2 weeks ago and I've been playing some online fairly recently. I usually play offline until I've learnt the relevant tech on my main and the game in general. I've played online quickplay for like 5 days now and I'm sitting at 5.6 mil GSP with my main Piranha Plant. I have put in a fair amount of hours vs multiple offline practice partners, spent time in the training mode and in watching lots of content. I'd say I'm fairly good and have a lot of practice in SSB. 

I feel kinda worried because the players I'm coming up against aren't that bad but they aren't very challenging at the same time. I've looked around and apparently I'm nearing elite smash which is good news as I really enjoy playing in neutral which doesn't happen very much at the moment.

"I challenge ANYONE stuck below 200,000 GSP to a fight","I'm tired of people that are frankly garbage at the game acting like they don't deserve to be down at that GSP. 

No, there is no ELO hell.

No, you're not stuck down there because GSP gain isn't fair.
No, it's not lag keeping you down there (this is the funniest excuse lmao).
Yes, it is spam keeping you there because you're bad to the point where you can't beat spam.
Yes, GSP is fairly accurate you just don't admit you're bad.


So if you're legitimately stuck that low (not down there on purpose) message me and I will show you the difference between you and elite.

Dear Extremely-Skilled Players Who Enter My Battle Arena... (TL:DR),"I respect all of you. Seriously. While I may not be able to barely win a game by the skin of my teeth or take a stock(hell, even land single fucking hit lol) fighting you serves as a reality check for me. There are players better than me, equal to me, and worse than me. I accept that. Knowing this is one way I don’t feel too down or salty whenever I lose. I just take it in stride, sometimes. Thankfully, most of the pros I’ve encountered online are chill too. They never taunt/teabag/flex on me and other players in my Arena. Few might even homie stock!

Fighting you gives me good experience. From constantly getting my ass kicked back and forth ten times in a row(because my main, Ridley’s big ass is combo food) I can learn, adapt and eventually, I may even be able to take a stock and actually ALMOST win a match. For example, this really great King Dedede named Mithran had a habit of jumping so I did take advantage of that and managed to take some stocks by punishing them with my own aerials or Up Smash. Tbh, it’s very exhilarating. I don’t mind.

HOWEVER, ffs I know you’re super skilled and all and winning is fucking awesome and shit but can you please stop hogging the 1st place for two hours straight? I respect your skill and I’m not saying you should always go into the back of the line just so some scrubs can play each other next. I’m just saying you should do it once in a while. Not to mention it’s pretty damn refreshing to fight someone else.

Do it for yourself too. By the time I or someone else actually manages to beat you, I guarantee it was only because you were too exhausted from constantly winning and kicking everyone else’s ass. I feel that too when I just so happen to somehow be the most skilled player in my 4 player, 1v1 Arena.

Mechanics I find toxic or too casual for competitive play,"These 4 things are based solely on my opinion + experiences, so take this post with a grain of salt. Feel free to deliberate in the comments below. I acknowledge the fact that these mechanics were conceptualized to fit the majority of players, that being casuals. Furthermore, this list isn't in any particular order.

1) Counters (typically DownBs):
This mechanic may get a pass due to its ""high risk, high reward"" aspect, but it's not all that respectable of a mechanic. It destroys virtually every character who has a recovery with a hitbox (i.e. Chrom, DK) and can easily take a stock if you're not careful. That last statement is especially true for light damage dealers and/or light characters (i.e. Sheik), as you may find yourself get absolutely wrecked by one counter after doing the same amount of damage in 20 hits. That being said, counters ARE heavily punishable and do need to be played around.

2) RNG: 
I heavily dislike RNG moves/movesets, like much of the Smash Bros community, as they make games sway from one player's favour to another very quickly with little to no strategy involved (RNG moves can either put you in an extremely disadvantageous or advantageous position). GnW sort of gets a pass for this as his SideB #9 is hard to actually land (as in, the probability is low) and the other outcomes negatively impact him. The Hero, however, doesn't get a pass due to his RNG-heavy moveset and especially his Crit mechanic (dealing much more damage AND knockback with no negative consequences and a substantial 12.5% chance of it occurring doesn't fit into competitive SSBU).

3) Comeback mechanics:
I'm specifically talking about the comeback mechanics which Joker, Wario, Little Mac, and Cloud have. These comeback mechanics take virtually no skill to charge (but do need some brain cells to be used effectively) as they are charged automatically and can turn the tide of a game in a moment's notice. This last part isn't a problem for me, but the fact that a certain amount of time or damage taken (not damage given) can grant one's character as huge knockback and/or damage buff is cancerous. I'd rather have all of these comeback mechanics be charged only with a button press: make Little Mac's neutral B useful by charging his KO punch, have Wario be able to build his Waft up with DownB, have Joker charge Arsene with DownB (whether he gets hit or not), and have Cloud charge his limit Neutral B faster, and remove all of these characters' automatic charges - these characters would be rendered more skillful to use.

4) Armour:
This is mainly useful for heavies, as they are allowed to take a bit of damage to dish out more in return and break through certain combos done by lighter characters. However, I'd rather have heavies dish out that same damage more quickly (less start-up on some moves, maybe less hitstun, but keep their weights the same) than just burst through a move without playing around it. You can make the same argument that I should play around armour moves, and that is a valid point, but I guess I'm too salty to respect armoured moves/characters as a Sheik main.",SmashBrosUltimate

Thought Experiment,"I'm a huge noob. I played a fair bit of Melee back in the day but I was never that good at Melee either. Recently trying to get back into it and I thought this would be a fun hypothetical. I've seen match up charts but I'm more interested in your individual solutions to the problem. What would YOU personally do in this situation:

1 timed stock match. 1 month to train. The loser dies in real life. This is a literal match to the death.
Player 1 is your friend. They have 0 experience with the game or even any character's source games, just general controller gaming experience, but they get to choose their character and ANY stage or variation, even non-tournament stages.
Player 2 is a below average casual player (like me) but you happen to know which character they will pick. What's your advice to your friend if you know Player 2 will pick
a) Cloud
b) Joker
What character/stage/strategy combo will give your friend the best chance?

Cloud and Joker are my main and secondary, but I'm also interested in insane counter strategies against other characters.",SmashBrosUltimate
What if you could cancel Cloud's limit charge similarly to focus attack or gun?,"I had one of those shower thinks on Cloud's limit charge mechanics and how sub par it feels so I got to thinking ""What would make this mechanic cool and fun to use?"" Previously Cloud was able to buffer attacks out of limit while standing which made the option less passive but with the move to ultimate this was taken away. Additionally with the increase in game speed, nerfed limit breaks, and not being able to hold a charge for more than 15 seconds charging limit became almost useless. By adding another property to limit charge the move could gain some more utility and allow Cloud, a rather simple character, to gain more depth. Paired with a couple of other changes like significantly increasing limit charge's charge speed, and reducing the limit charge hold time to 10 seconds but ramping up the bonus to Cloud's air and ground speed over the duration could make this character kinda hype.

These are just some shower thoughts I wanted to share, what do you guys think?",SmashBrosUltimate

GSP logic tales n°10293863829,"I don't know how else to flair any topic involving GSP, sorry. 

So here I am trying to play a bit of peach, she is one of the only characters of my roster that is still sub 3mil GSP. So i was about to try and rank her up. That's when I get a Ness. Awesome. I just wanted to play 2 games and break it off but ofc it had to be a Ness. You need to know that Ness, Tink, Yink and Chrom are my most hated characters. Whenever I have to fight one of those I regret going online.

Anyway so this ness is not your typical pkfire spammer but an actual good and annoying one. And one who identified my weaknesses and actually forced me to adapt. So we were initially around the same GSP: me 2.5mil and him at 3.2 or more, didn't check at first. 

After our 6-7 matches (which I all lost) he left. I don't mind deranking and playing a good ness, I need to learn the matchup better and the connection was ok except for one match so I kept going. The reason I stayed longer was because of his BM BS of spiking me or me stupidly SDing and him teabagging me and I really wanted to beat him once. Anyway we wnd our session with me down to 600k and him at 4.6mil GSP. 

I get back in Q and I get matched with that exact same ness (who seemingly didn't want to play me anymore and understandably so) but wth? 

According to GSP logic, shouldn't I get matched with someone at around my newly set rank? I mean I didn't mind, it gave me a chance to see if I can take him now. And I won. But it felt like he wasn't in it anymore. But he didn't seem to want to end it on a loss and rematched. That match was tougher but I was starting to get better reads on him and took that one  too. 

I ended up at 1.1mil abd he stayed around 4mil GSP . 

Basically: I still can't figure out GSP or the point of it. But I'm thankful it allowed me to get my revenge on that Ness!",SmashBrosUltimate

"New player, picked up Shulk and could use some pointers/info.","I got the game for Christmas and decided to main Shulk (I am not new to Smash as a whole and have experience with the game). I'm aware that Shulk is a very complex character, so I was wondering if anyone can give me some tips/tricks? YouTube links and names of pro Shulk mains are appreciated too. Another question I have is, who is a good secondary for Shulk? I don't know the match ups of any characters well, so I don't know what Shulk is bad at or who can cover what he can't.

My knowledge so far:

* Jump Art is great for edge-guarding and recovering, but not good in neutral because of the decreased defense and can put you in a bad situation without a reliable escape option.

* Speed Art is a great rush-down tool and is great for N-air/F-air chains due to the decreased jump height. Decreases damage.

* Shield Art is useful to swap to in hit-stun to drop out of a combo, but also makes Shulk heavy, slow, and do less damage, so it's best to use it to escape a combo and then immediately get back to vanilla Shulk (or any other Art for the situation).

* Buster Art is the combo tool and makes you take more damage in return. Not much to say here.

* Smash Art is the kill move and makes you get knocked back farther to balance. Useful at ledge to kill at crazy low percents.

* N-air is big.

* F-air is big.

* B-air is a good horizontal kill move.

* D-air spikes (on the 2nd hit).

* Tilting the stick in the direction of the attacker during Vision will give you farther-launching less-damaging counter.

* Auto-canceling N-air and F-air is a good idea.

* Up-tilt is a good idea.

* Down-tilt is a good idea.

* F-tilt is a good idea.

* Down-throw into anything that exists. 

* Down-Smash is spinny and fun.

* F-smash is strong, long, and can be angled. 

* Countering in the air is probably a bad idea.

* Don't jump off-stage and edge-guard without Jump Art available.

* Side-taunt.

And if this counts as low effort, I apologize and will not be upset by the removal of the post.",SmashBrosUltimate

Arena or quick play for new player?,"Hi,
I've been playing smash ultimate for a bit but never online (the adventure mode and kicking around with the spirit board with my wife).
I decided to start playing online, went to quickplay, selected some preferred rules like no items, 3 stocks and 5 minutes time limit, and here I go.
As expected I'm terrible and every single person I am matched up against wipe the floor with me.
I don't mind, I'm still having fun but a lot of players teabag after taking a stock from me, and from reading this Reddit, I gather it's a rude gesture? Is it because they consider I'm wasting their time? They don't like my rules? 
Should I play arena and advertise it's only for begginers or terrible players only?

My favorite thing about Smash Ultimate is the low gsp bagger.,"No sarcasm. I'm not the worst, but I'm not the best either. I tend to rematch everyone until they decide not to rematch, and this helps me learn the game. So my favorite thing I come across, quite frequently, is the low gsp bagger. They will beat me 5 or more games in a row, and bag every single match. I ignore it, and try to learn their playstyle. What makes them my favorite is their tendency to quit rematching after the very first time I manage to best them. It's even better if they rematch one more time assuming it was a fluke, and promptly disconnect if they start losing again.

PK Flash,"
So I am a Ness main, (no I don’t spam pk Fire) and I have some ideas for PK Flash. For those of you that aren’t familiar with PK Flash, (or PSI Flash in the American version) it is a move Ness can utilize in Earthbound. In the original game, using PK Flash can cause enemies to cry uncontrollably, go numb, feel strange, go unconscious, and rarely, disappear entirely. I think that in smash bros, this was a missed opportunity. I think that when PK Flash is used in smash, it should have a chance to inflict several conditions, such as flowery, or the mushroom thing. I also think that when fully charged it should have a rare chance or killing the opponent entirely. (Maybe like 1/50) I also think that the chance should go up    when the opponent is at high damage. (Like 1/5 when Opponent is 100% or higher) This May seem overpowered, but I recommend trying to hit somebody with a PK Flash. I feel like these would be some very cool additions to the game.",SmashBrosUltimate

Dovahkiin Is Finally Awake: Character Concept,"This is my dream character and I think he could have some interesting mechanics if he makes it into the game.

Unique shield: Lifts shield ( or offhand weapon) and only blocks in front of him but angling the shield allows him to move, if you run into someone while shielding then it causes a small amount of damage and knockback.  Jabbing out of shield bashes with the shield.

Unique crouch: Dovahkiin gets partial invisibility while crouched after 1 second, all attacks out of stealth cause double damage but normal knockback.

Neutral B (Hunting Bow): Shoots an arcing arrow causing damage and a small amount of knockback similar to link but can be angled similar to yoshi eggs.

Side B (Fus Ro Dah): Dovahkiin uses the Thu'um to shout back enemies causing a small amount of damage and a lot of knockback, has a sweet spot that sends enemies flying and causes a tech chase.

Up B (Whirlwind Sprint): Dovahkiin uses the Thu'um to rush forward instantly, can be angled in any direction.

Down B (Fire Breath): Dovahkiin uses the Thu'um to blast his enemies with fire, enemies on fire take extra damage.

Jab: pulls out dagger to quickly attack, repeated attacks causes a flurry of strikes

Dash attack: Leaps forward with his sword

F-tilt: Quickly slashes in front of him with sword

D-tilt: Slashes horizontally along the ground with sword

U-tilt: Slashes above with his sword in an arc

F-Smash: A powerful horizontal slash with his sword

D-smash: Dovahkiin uses the Thu'um to breath frost at the ground in front of him, has a sweet spot that freezes enemies, they are frozen for longer at higher percents

U-Smash: Heals Himself slightly with restoration magic, charging for longer heals more.

Nair: Slashes with his sword then bashes with shield

Fair: Slashes in front of him with his sword in an arc

Dair: Slams down with his shield, has a spike sweet spot but very short range and a long windup

Bair: Shoots a frost bolt behind slightly slowing enemies and causing damage

Uair (Dragonrend): Dovahkiin uses the Thu'um to shout above him in a small cone forcing an enemy into fastfall, has a lot of lag after making it difficult to use offstage 

Dthrow: Jumps on top of enemy and stabs them with his sword, causes tech chase

Fthrow: Throws enemy forward then shoots them with a fireball causing hit stun based on percentage.

Bthrow: Bashes enemy behind him with his shield

Uthrow: Holds up enemy and hits them with lightning.

Pummel: Punches with sword

Final Smash (Summon Durnheviir): Shouts to call down a dragon that can be controlled to grab enemies and shout them off stage.

Kirby: Iron Helmet

Overall he would a heavy character with poor jumping ability and fast falling speed based on forcing enemies to approach him on the ground with restoration and dragonrend and causing damage from afar.  His weakness would be aerial and offstage game.  He could be played as a footsie character controlling center stage, a bait and punish with his shield and sneak attacks, or a zoner with his bow and Bair.

Costumes would be different races and factions

Standard: Nord with Iron armor and horned helmet from trailer art

Imperial: Imperial with Heavy imperial armor and sword

Stormcloak: Nord with stormcloak armor and axe

Thalmor: Altmer with elven armor and weapons

Thief: Khajiit with daggers and thieves guild armor

Vigilant of Stendar: Breton with mace, shield, and robe

Hunter: Bosmer with hunter attire and war axe

Assasin: Dunmer with Dark brotherhood armor and daggers

Pirate: Argonian with sword, shield, and pirate clothes

Orc:  heavy armor and war axe

Redguard: Curved swords, Curved. Swords.

Stage: Western watchtower, dragon attacks occasionally destroying parts of stage when hazards are on

Hopefully the last dragonborn is added eventually, since skyrim is on switch and it's one of the best selling games of all time I think there is a chance.",SmashBrosUltimate

Keep jumping away and hold spawn invincibility as long as you can if you die.  It's kinda crazy I see a lot of tourney players where the rules arent that strict not taking advantage.  It works because while joker is op,  Joker players use him as a crutch.  In my experience so far 100% (11/11) of Joker players online panic at this strat pretty much confirming that.

"Mainstay titles, Offshoot characters","If you could have a DLC pack of characters from mainstay Nintendo titles, but were in no way close to spotlight characters from their own games, what 5 would you pick and from what [mainstay] title.

Kirby: I would like either Knuckle Joe (he was my favorite sidekick in Kirby All-stars, and was kinda disappointed he showed up as an AT and not a Kirby rep), or the Plasma guy (favorite absorbable enemy)

LoZ: I feel like Tingle could be a ton of fun as a kind of trickster character similar to Villiager. I also would really like to see the Witch Sisters from OoT. They could play with similar mechanics to Ice Climbers. 

Donkey Kong: Its a damn shame that none of K. Rools soldiers got in. Treat it like Pokemon Trainer, with down b switching between the 4-legged chompy guy, the buff bi-pedal one and the fat helmet wearing one. 

Yoshi's Island (Mario): that wizard guy. I can't remember his name, but he's the koopa that harasses you the whole game and transforms enemies into bosses. His move set potential is huge.

Character concept: Darmanitan,"I think Darmanitan from Pokemon would be an interesting addition as DLC, even though I doubt it'll ever happen. This is just my concept.

To start off, Darmanitan has a unique ability known as Zen Mode that turns it into a psychic type and emphasizes projectile attacks. In addition, it has a Galarian form that is an ice type (ice/fire in Zen Mode) which could be an alternate costume although the changes may be too drastic for a costume change and more appropriate for an echo fighter. If it is, then regular Darmanitan would be the base and the Galarian form would have to have some liberties taken. In the games, Zen Mode is triggered when Darmanitan reaches half health or lower. This could potentially translate to Smash in one of two ways: First, it could have a meter like Terry that transforms Darmanitan when it reaches 100%, or it could just be a swap with down B like Zelda/Shiek used to be.

Here's a rough concept for the moveset. The Galarian form move names will be in parentheses. Darmanitan would likely have a similar weight and power to DK.

Jab:
Standard: fire punch (ice punch), a strong 2 or 3 hit jab
Zen: something similar to Mewtwo's jab

Tilts:
Standard: Some variation on fire punch (ice punch), similar to DK
Zen: no idea, something like mewtwo

Forward Smash:
Standard: hammer arm (ice hammer*), a strong but laggy move that goes in a forward arc
Zen: some blast of psychic (fire) energy like Mario's

Up and down smash:
Standard: once again, some variation of fire punch (ice punch), maybe something similar to DK's
Zen: extrasensory (blizzard): similar to Lucas but maybe more purple

Aerials: 
Standard: similar to DK. I don't have any ideas on specific ones
Zen: similar to Ness, but bigger, heavier, and slower. Once again, I don't have any specifics

Grabs and throws: 
Standard: maybe a cargo throw like DK. If you want to keep DK unique in that aspect, maybe something similar to K. Rool's throws with some more similar to Mario.
Zen: something like Mewtwo or Ness

Neutral special:
Standard: focus punch, large punch maybe similar to Ganondorf's warlock punch or Little Mac's neutral special
Zen: flamethrower (powder snow): similar to Charizard/Bowser

Side special: 
Standard: flare blitz, similar to Charizard, maybe more powerful at the cost of more self damage and/or more lag
Zen: psybeam (ice beam), similar effect to a staff item that does more damage the further away Darmanitan is, but a bit slower than the staff.

Down special: 
Standard and Zen: work up, a move that takes some time to use, but increases attack power for a short time, similar to Hero's spell that I'm blanking on the name of.
This could also be the swap between standard and zen mode.

Up special: 
Standard: heat crash* (avalanche), Darmanitan pushes fire (ice) downward to get extra height, meant to be a better attack than recovery. It could also spike.
Zen: uproar, Darmanitan pushes soundwaves downward to gain height, maybe similar to Robin's

Final Smash:
Standard: Earthquake into Giga Impact. Darmanitan makes a shockwave on the ground on both sides of it that buries, then it does some kind of massive blow. 
Zen: Hyper beam, big sideways beam similar to Samus (I know, not very original).

Can we talk about Ultimate's poor music library?,"I mean, good lord. There are *SO* many amazing songs absent. Why isn't Koopa's Road in? Why isn't half the Mario RPG music in, like every final boss song? Why do we only get 1 Paper Mario song, when there are so many good soundtracks in the series. 

Not to mention how Kirby got screwed over. Kirby has always had an amazing soundtrack, so where's the amazing music? Sure, CROWNED and 02 battle got in, but where's the orignal 02 song, or the final boss song for Planet Robobot or Star Allies? 

I mean, I understand that the music library is more about the history of Nintendo than anything else, but a large part of Mario history is the RPG's which Ultimate ignores music-wise. Also, 3 F-Zero GX songs, and no Infinite Blue? What the hell?

A Ness Rant that has nothing to do with PK Fire,"I always defend Ness mains, I dont think they deserve the flack they get, and the PK Fire bad meme died years ago and the community doesnt know how to let a joke die.

With that aside, I feel as though fighting a Ness has become extremely lackluster. Not frustrating, not annoying, just boring. Why? Because I know exactly what I'm in for.

I feel everyone plays a character differently except for Ness and I'm not sure if it's because of how he's designed, but let me explain. 

Every match, a Ness main will just hop around hoping one of his disjointed aerials hit. This happens in normal quick play, battle arenas, and elite smash. They'll also use PK Fire for down throw fair combos, and yo yo at the ledge. That's all Ness mains do:

PK Fire -&gt; dthrow -&gt; fair

Hop around using aerials

Yo-yo at the ledge

I know Ness can be used more creatively, I've seen it for myself. Down special can work wonders in combos. But instead it's like 90% of Ness mains just copy each other and basically do the same thing every match. It's just become boring at this point, they're predictable and easy to punish, which also makes me question why everyone complains about him. Hardly anyone is unique when playing as him!",SmashBrosUltimate
"Call me crazy, but I think Rex/Pyra actually stands a good chance at being DLC","Now here me out. They will certainly not be the 5th fighter in the Fighter’s Pass. I think that one will most definitely be third party (maybe Lloyd? Crash?)   Anyway, I believe Rex and Pyra have one of the highest chances out of any other 1st party characters to get in for the Wave 2 DLC, which I theorize will include a lot more 1st party characters. This is because of Sakurai’s affinity for Xenoblade 2 and the fact that Rex would’ve been put in the game had the timing been better. But I know what you’re thinking, the mii costume. I too thought the mii costume was a barrier to their entry, but after it was announced that more fighters were on the way, the mii costume I felt like became more and more of a consolation prize. Something that said, “here’s this costume for now, you’ll get the character later.” And now I just feel like later is soon to come. The time just feels ripe to me.",SmashBrosUltimate

Possible New Smash Map Pool Rule Set,"What if, instead of a starter/counterpick setup, there was a larger map pool that players took turns banning from initially. Say, 15 maps from different legal rulesets. Each player gets 5 bans. Then, you can rps for first pick and continue to pick and counterpick as per usual. This would allow for variance and keep rule sets fresh, as well as allow for the players to take advantage of the vastness of Ultimate. Also, if you have any maps you absolutely don't want to play, you can eliminate those from play immediately, while still possibly getting your niche counterpick if the other player chooses to allow it.
 
This whole idea allows for the players to control their set a little more, while still making sure nobody gets stuck on something they really absolutely hate. I don't think it would cause a giant distortion from how rule sets are currently formed, but it does keep things moving forward.",SmashBrosUltimate

Nero,I played a Pikachu main who was calling themselves Nero. I was no where near their skill level not sure if it was actually Nero but whoever it is was a pro player.

Buff Rosalina Rant,"* Doesnt grab the ledge half the time on recovery. SOMEONE explain why im in a helpless state half the time. I hit the ledge, and she flies right past it
* Luma dies with a touch in the ledge. Dont go to the ledge? None of her attacks can kill from center stage
* Light but giant target
* Down air hit box doesnt match with graphics. I see the ring phase through people so many times, even see it on replay frame by frame
* Star bits has as much range as shulks sword  and you cant perform it if Luma got hit. Shes basically a close range fighter
* Literally none of her attacks kill except forward smash or up smash, back air didnt kill someone at 170%, seriously embarassing
* Shooting luma out will lose to every projectile no matter or small it is youre basically close range 
* Luma shot is supposed to provide spacing but not when it has so much ending lag, and calling it back as lag and shooting it off stage causes it to get hit and die
* No auto cancel. Forward air is just asking for someone to hit me when I land on my back needing about 15 frames to get up but captain falcon can get up in 4 frames?
* Marios up smash can hit behind him and gives him invincibility frames but rosalinas up smash doesnt hit behind her
* Serious ending lag on all attacks. Dash attack, side b, neutral b, as much lag as a smash attack
* NO PROTECTION WHEN USING RECOVERY
* Smash attacks do hardly any knock back without Luma

My Thoughts on the final fighter DLC,"Waluigi. 

Well that would be lame to just leave it to that. Of course I’m hoping for our purple-clothes mustachioed pretty boy, but I know there’s a very low chance of him getting in. Sure, we could get some kind of trailer showing a room filled with assist trophy’s being lined up on shelves and then one of them breaking and revealing the slim gentleman we’ve all grown to love.. but I don’t want to keep my hopes up. 

Looking at this statistically it seems more favorable that Nintendo would want to make the last fighter somebody who could turn a profit. An advertising character, with how Joker was. If it turns out to be something like this then my best assumptions would be Steven from Minecraft, Travis Touchdown from No More Heroes, or perhaps a new Zelda, like the new version shown in the BOTW2 trailer.

Extremely quick wear on HORI Battle Pad,"Do not purchase a HORI Battle Pad, mine is breaking after 3 1/2 months.

The left joystick has lost about 2/3 of its texture, and the left upper shoulder button has become worn internally, so that if pressed on the right side, it does not register.

Down B: demon binding circle (puts a card thingy on the ground wich creates a pillaor of light acting as a wall for a while nullifiying all projectiles but you can still walk through and attack through it at the cost of taking some nonflinching damage! with no charge when she throws it down it dosnt do anything but she just leaves it there letting a foe trip on it. in both case only one can be out at a time)

Up B: god wind (a quick series up flipping kicks upward kinda like dks up b but vertical but with no charge she just jumps up and does a sort of diving ram kinda like incineroar)

Final Smash: final heaven (7 yinyangs appear around her and she has to light em up by succesfully landing her b attacks and if this is successful she unleahses the fantasy heaven raining down amulets everywhere)

Victory Theme: isnt there some kinda winning theme? im not sure...

Victory Poses: (How will your fighter celebrate they're victory?)

Option 1: dusts herself off and puts away her stick

Option 2: rests with some tea

Option 3: puts away her stick and looks around before noticing the camera and throwing a talisman at it

Finally about 5 minutes in when I had 1 stock left and already at 70% I decided to just not move at all, I stood perfectly still, and this player attacked the air around him spamming for a solid minute, no movement at all, just spamming every directional smash he could, until the match just ended, came no where near me or hit me once once I stopped moving completely.

Why does every iteration of this game shit on heavies?,"As a Bowser and King K main, I've often too many times have been hit when facing behind the opponent, been hit by moves that are clearly not in contact, been hit when my shield is clearly active, and been juggled to no end, what the hell does sakurai have against heavies? Is it just a inherent design flaw that the devs can't seen to get their heads around? I'd really like to know because as a heavy main this game is one of the most unfair fighting games in existence.

What if Bellsprout was a ridiculously silly skin for Pichu. They’re close enough in size that a stupidly fast plant with the same moves (obviously change the electricity to someone grass based) would be a lot of fun. 

Honestly I’m just getting creative. Rosalina &amp; luma could be replaced with waluigi and boo. Instead of him waving a wand to bring boo back he would wave his arm to bring him in or point to deploy him.

I cant seem to get any better,"Ive been playing ultimate for a little under a year now, and while i know that ive made significant progress, it feels like for the past couple of months i havent been able to make any at all. I play with my friends, as well as online, and before i could keep up with my friends as we progressed and improved, and every month i would be able to hit a new record for my gsp. But recently it just feels like ive hit a brick wall.

It feels like my friends just keep getting better and better, and im just stuck at the same level, no matter how much i practice. Ive recently picked up greninja and no matter how much i practice i just keep getting bodied. My greninja is floating around 200k-300k in gsp, and even at this low of gsp i feel like everyone is miles ahead of me and anytime i win its by the skin of my teeth and i feel like its just when i get lucky on a read or something. My king k rool and ridley are sitting at about 5million, but this is just because im good at spacing ridleys neutral air, so i just spam it, and then i get lucky with a read and land a fsmash. And i can just spam hyper armor and projectiles with king k.

When it comes down to actually playing neutral, i feel like i dont even know where to start, and it feels like everyone is miles ahead of me. I just kind of throw out hitboxes and hope for the best. Everyone talks about things like spacing, moves that are safe on shield, and everyone else seem like they have a strong hold on things like when to roll, spot dodge,  ect. But i have no idea how to practice any of these things effectively. I watch tonnes of videos on practice regiments, and things like ledge guarding, baiting ect. And ill spend hours practicing, but it seems like no matter what or how much i practice, as soon as its the real thing nothing works. CPU's are too dumb to get any real practice (or at least in the way that i practice on them), and people are too fast for me to ever be able to get comfortable using the techniques im trying to learn. 

The bottom line is i just dont understand how to get better at the neutral game. No matter how many videos i watch (whether its tutorials or watching others play), i cant seem to learn or get better at any of these new skills. I understand neutral is complex but i dont even know where to start. So i was just wondering if anybody has any tips or effective training regiments that really help in learning the neutral game (or any part of the game really). Because no matter how much i practice i can never seem to utilize any of it.

Additionally, ill go over what i do to train:

-usually 30-45 mins of practicing movement (short hops, moving on platforms ect.)
-1 hour practicing combos and kill confirms (another area i struggle with and needs improvement: no matter how much i practice this, i can never seem to pull any strings off in a real battle, its rare that i can land 3 consecutive hits, so any tips on how to learn to combo effectively would help)
-practicing more character specific things like edge guarding, spacing ect for maybe 30 minutes
-usually about 30mins-1hr fighting bots

Main issues ive noticed:
-cant combo effectively, or do kill confirms
-have a hard time keeping up with other people, everyone always seems 3 steps ahead of me
-not good at understanding when to roll, spot dodge, or shield, always seem to pick the worst option and always gets punished
-dont know how to break combos, and i get juggled lots
-just dont really know how to play neutral very well, and dont know how to improve

Any advice would sincerely be appreciated!",SmashBrosUltimate

I made a move set idea for the monster hunter. Sorry it’s lengthy I had a lot of details. Will include normal a moves and aerials next time!,"Monster Hunter Smash Character Movesset:
Note: At character selection screen you can choose one of 3 weapon classes-
Blade(S)- Includes Greatsword, Longsword, Lance, and Hammer
Gun- Includes Bowgun (heavy and light), Bow, Dual Blades, and Gunlance
Status-Charged Blade, Switchaxe, and Sword and Shield
Each weapon class only changes the normal moves only but the specials stay the same. 

Specials:
B- Item Pouch Cycle: Hold B and use bumpers to cycle through items and press B to 
use the item
Side B- Carve: Swing carving sword right in front of you. If it hits, you pin person on the floor and carve. Quick and chance for item drop
Up B- (I had 2 ideas so choose)
(1)Recover: Slightly changes depending on the weapon class. If Blade the use Greatsword to launch yourself up and recover while spinning (Moon Breaker). If gun you use gunlance to launch yourself in the air creating an explosion at the bottom. If Status you use switch axe to discharge element to propel yourself.
(2) Aerial Jump: MH Gen U aerial jump (self explanatory) 
Down B- (Again I had 3 so choose)
(1)Counter: Depending on Weapon class it changes slightly. If Blade it goes into a Longsword slash (Critical Juncture). If Gun you use heavy bowgun and shield  and block and fire 3 shots in front towards the ground. If Status, you block with charged blade shield and strike.
(2)Shield: If Blade then you use Greatsword to block, If Gun you use gunlance shield to block, and if Status you use Charged Blade Shield. 
Item Pouch: Can only use stone and tranq bomb in the air, but the rest need to be on the ground, and weapon class adds 1 item. 
(3)Evade: You Valor stand To avoid from the opponent. It can be held but you take damage the longer you hold it (damage increases 1% rapidly if held, but if timed correctly none taken). This does not damage you or the opponent, but it you just move out of the way. While you evade you are invincible until you finish the animation with little or no end lag to making it good for punishing.

Item pouch only refills after 3 stocks lost (which is why there are so many)
Stone (x5): Does 1% or 1hp and just staggers opponent
Potion (x5)- Recovers 5% or 10 hp
Mega Potion (x5)-Recovers 10% or 20 hp            
Tranq Bomb (x8)- Depending on percent it can make the opponent sleep (over 50% need 2, over 100% need one)
Barrel Bomb (L)(x3)- Placed down on the ground. Will explode if hit by an enemy, or comes in contact. However if you are caught in the blast you take the damage too and it could Kill. Can stack all 3 on top of each other and will be detonated if hit by projectile (like stone)
Shock Trap (x2)- Opponent gets paralyzed in whatever position they were in when they came into contact with the trap, and the duration depends on the percent they are at. 
Adamant Seed (x5)- Reduces damage taken and knockback and can be stacked with both seeds. 30 sec duration 
Mega Demon Drug (x3)- Increases the attack on the next attack and guarantees critical hit. Cannot be stacked (if you try you just waste an item)
Blade Item: Whetstone (x3)- Increases chance of a critical attack by 40% for 15 sec
Gun Item: Special Ammo (x3)- Activates Crouch fire, shots 6 shots rapidly that lock opponent, and then fires a crag shot that explodes a little after sticking to enemy
Status Item: Affinity Oil (x1)-Increases chance of critical attack by 20% for 30 sec

Taunts (gestures):
Up Taunt- Wave
Side Taunt- Shadow Box (this taunt loops and does damage, but doesn’t flintch)
Down Taunt-Scavenge (crouches down on stage and looks for an item. There is a chance to find a good item but doing the taunt to completely only gives you an herb, that recovers 1%, a stone, or a monster part that does nothing.)

Alt Colors: 4 male and 4 female 
Rathalos Armor (Default)
Kirin Armor  
Deviljho Armor
Testucabra Armor

How the Wait For Terry Bogard Became Unbearable,"I have been feeling like waiting for Terry Bogard has been a much more painful wait than any DLC character so far. Around yesterday, I realized some facts about the DLC release schedule and have come up with an opinion on how the release for Terry Bogard was handled the worst out of the current characters..

At the start of Smash Ultimate, we learned about Piranha Plant before release and then Joker approximately at release. The wait for Piranha Plant wasn't too bad, coming out a month and a half after release. Even better, the game was still new... we had to take time to adjust to all the changes to old characters and also wonder who would emerge on top of the competitive scene. Basically, Piranha Plant's release didn't matter much in terms of properly controlling hype, especially since they were a bit of a joke character.

Joker was a much more serious and anticipated character. Although it took about 3 months for Joker to finally be released, there was still enough newness to the game, making the wait for Joker still manageable. Additionally, Joker's approximate release date was not known until around April, unless I am mistaken. Keeping it secret until near release is a good move in my opinion.

Then E3 came.  First of all, E3 took place in June, basically two months after Joker.  In my opinion, they did what they should do in every DLC character reveal. During those first two months after Joker, we didn't know who was coming and we couldn't be 100% sure E3 would even have a reveal, so we didn't have to feel like ""Oh, I don't want this character, bring on the next one...... This wait is way too long!"" At E3, they surprised us and announced two characters at once, and also didn't tell us when they would be released. This is good because both characters satisfied different fanbases and the depth of Hero's moveset was their selling point. Even better, Hero came only about a month later, but it felt like super fast..... Banjo managed to come with the fastest gap imaginable, only a month after Hero....

Clearly not every reveal can be this good, rate-wise, but I think that even if we had to wait 3 months for the reveal of two characters who came a month apart, it would be so much more satisfying every time. Plus, being able to show off more than a really simplistic display of the character moveset gave us a lot more to think about....

Terry came after the Banjo and Kazooie announcement..... His release date was stated to be some time in November. Although this was only about two months later, we hadn't had such a poorly timed approximate release before this one. First of all, we instantly knew approximately when they were about to come out Compared to other reveals, it gave us both too much information and not enough, making the wait more excruciating than it should be. Terry, as I was hinting to earlier, also only had very basic display of his moves, just showing the expected two special moves that were never really impressive in the first place. If they had been able to slow down this next reveal and also reveal the final season 1 DLC character at the same time, they could have shown a lot more of how Terry would actually work, maybe some costumes, etc, while also giving us the excitement for the new character (who is really hard to predict right now) so that people who don't care about Terry would have something to look forward to and still have time to figure out whether or not they really disliked the character.

So yeah, that last paragraph is basically the reasons why I think Terry Bogard's reveal was done really poorly and I really hope Sakurai doesn't do something like this again.",SmashBrosUltimate

Is quickplay simply a camp-fest now?,"It’s ridiculous.  

Are we just camping now?  Is that the new hotness?  

I’ve been playing Quickplay more often, and it seems the meta online has devolved to complete nonsense.  Even Mario camps now — all of them.  There’s zero variety.  They all constantly jump around, and shoot fire balls.  If you look like you’re getting close, they try to bait you with a falling back-air.  

The wild thing is, it doesn’t even work.  It just slows the game down to the most insipid pace possible, and siphons ever ounce of fun out of the match.  

Don’t get me wrong, I get it.  If you are Zelda player, you need to camp.  It’s a necessity.  If you’re a Belmont, camp away.  Isabelle?  I expect to see a tent propped firmly on your side of the stage.  But, lord, strike me down right now.  We even have Foxes camping.  It’s completely absurd.  I even had a Roy try to camp me today while I played Greninja.  

Is this just how you’re supposed to play Quickplay, or am I missing something?  

The game seems like it’s slowing down every month.  It feels less like Smash Bros, and more like Samurai Shodown at this point.  Everyone plays the same, regardless of character archetype.  No one approaches, and then once you take your time, and win neutral, they haul ass to the other side of the stage and camp even harder.

I can’t be the only one noticing that matches are beginning to take longer, and longer am I?

Akira Howard (Legionis) for Smash Bros. Part 1 of 3,"Background Info: Look here on this post from Smashboards, it’s how I got my inspiration to make this moveset. https://smashboards.com/threads/akira-howard-protagonist-enlists-into-battle-astral-chain.487680/  Now let’s get one thing straightened out, the MC of the game Astral Chain is not named Akira. The MC has a twin named Akira, the MC is bard whatever you want but when you play as the male character the twin is female and vice versa, so I sort of just went with that. But enough on names, let’s get on with the moveset.

Jab: Right from its home game, jab attack would be the 4 part attack with no Legion, 3 swings of the X-Baton and a kick which could be followed up with a Legion.

Dash Attack: The dash attack would be a slide covering a small to mid range, it would have some end lag but not too serious.

Tilt Attacks: Forward tilt would be a two part kick using the Gladius baton as a stilt. Down tilt would be a simple sweep kick, good for combos. Up tilt was be a moonsault kick launching the opponent up in the air, sort of like Nash’s Flash kick.

Smash Attacks: All of the Smash Attacks will feature the 
Gladius baton, or the heavy baton game. Forward Smash is a swift slash, which looks similar to Ike’s Side B, which can be both tilted and followed up with a Legion. Up Smash is like Ike and Ganondorf’s except it can be followed up with a Legion. Down Smash was hard to do but I made something similar to Fire Emblem down smash, Legionis’s down smash would be a full 360 spin leading with the foot, having the Gladius covering all around them.

Aerials: Neutral Air will be like Joker’s, using the Gladius baton doing a 360 spin in the air. Forward Air will be a forward axe  kick. Back Air will be a quick move with the normal baton, like Robin back air except quicker. Down Air will be an Ike down air but using the Gladius Baton. Up Air will be an upwards swing of the Gladius baton.

Grabs and Throws: The Legionis will have two grabs, the normal grab will be an up close grab with a pummel similar to that of Joker’s, using his knee. Forward throw will be a kick pushing the opponent away, Down throw will be a forward flip and the Gladius being driven down into the opponent like a full on slam, Up throw will be a backward flip kick, and Back Throw will be a spin to get behind the opponent and getting a good swing with the Gladius sending them flying backwards, the motion would be similar to that of Mii Swordfighter’s tornado neutral B.",SmashBrosUltimate
Akira Howard (Legionis) for Smash Bros.,"Legions: The 5 Legions you use will be like Joker’s Arsene, but if Arsene could be sent out like a pseudo-puppet character and did his own attacks. The Legions can be sent out at certain ranges, I would say on how far you would flick them when at a distance, flick the stick fast and it goes far but hold the stick in a direction and the Legion doesn’t really go anywhere. But when you’re up close, you only use amplified moves like Joker and Arsene. Tilts and Aerials will change as well, and small note they all will have the same Up B except for Beast since he’s mainly a land type. Each Legion will have their own unique set of moves. Also certain moves can be followed up but I won’t go super in-depth. 

The Sword Legion is a basic yet powerful and up close kind of Legion. It’s Side Special for Sword will also be Hit Rush, but this time both Legionis and the Sword Legion can attack from both sides. Neutral Special will be Triple Sword, blades that circle around the Legion for a certain amount of time or depending how much damage the blades take. It can be used as a walking hit box sort of like Melee Ness when he uses PK Thunder at the right time, except when it’s being sent out it can attack or be attacked. Down Special will be Power Boost, giving an attack boost which can only be used once per stock, which also lasts about 20 seconds.

The Arrow Legion is a range based Legion, during barrages of projectiles. It’s Neutral B will be Arrow Blast, whenever Legionis is during the gun, the Arrow Legion will help with partial barrages. In the end, it will do a follow up firing a pseudo-R.O.B. like beam in the shape of an arrow at the end. It’s Side Special is Air Shot, the Arrow Legion firing into the air and arrows will rain down on the opponent. It’s Down Special will be Slow Shot, Arrow Legion fires a single arrow into the air and if it hits, the opponent is slowed down like Bayonetta Witch Time. However it can be air dodged, normally dodged, or reflected. It can miss if they’re running around but if they’re standing still and shielding they can be hit and they will be slowed down.

The Beast Legion is a fast land type Legion using fetal attacks like a wolf. The Neutral Special will be Ride, allowing Legionis to ride the Beast Legion while automatically dodge certain attacks but it can only dodge for so long that it begins to slow down like usual dodging. Side Special will be Beast Tornado, Legionis will grab the Beast Legion by its chain and it’ll swing it around like a tornado. This can be avoided by simply jumping due to it it being a more ground struck move. Down Special will be Howl, this move will stun the enemies like the Deku Nut, making them dizzy. This has a certain radius to it, which can be avoided but when hit by it, it’ll last like a normal shield break.

The Axe Legion, a Legion based on raw strength and defense. Neutral Special will be the Rising Axe, a slow yet strong overhead  swing of the axe. Side Special will be Crash Bomb, the Axe Legion will send out an astral projection of its axe and it’ll impale the stage working like a bomb. Only two can be sent out and if it isn’t touched it’ll explode, like Snake’s grenades. Down Special will be Blue Shield, an all around shield protecting Legionis from attacks. It has a limited amount of uses and has a slow recharge time. 

The Arm Legion, everyone’s favorite Jojo meme and an up close Legion. Down Special will be Arm Legion Armor, Legionis will wear the Arm Legion as a suit of armor and they’ll float and deliver slow yet strong flurry jabs while also delivering heavy damage. Side Special will be Gravity Storm, the Arm Legion will send out a sort of black hole, sucking the opponent into the hole. It has limited usage, meaning it’s something to be preserved. It’s both ground and aerial ok.",SmashBrosUltimate

Thé Piranha Plant Paradox (for me at least),"So I'm sure everyone here knows of this first and somewhat, disappointing DLC character Piranha Plant.

Now I've never really been a fan to play Piranha Plant, only as a joke to mess around with my friends. After a month of messing with the character, I can say that I can 1v1 my friends and win with Plant Gang. My friends are not incompetent idiots, as a matter of fact I loose more than I win.

Part of me wants to say that no one plays piranha plant so they don't know how to counter it, but another part of me wants to say that there is a lot of potential in Piranha Plant as a hole.

With a down 🅱️ that's good for spacing, a neutral 🅱️ that's good for ledge guarding and spacing as well. An up 🅱️ that can save you from the bottom and sides of the map. Fairs and Bairs that aren't half as bad either.

Challenge proposal,"I don't know if people are even gonna see this, or if someone already did this, but here goes.

The Win Streak Challenge: Basically, you get a single win online with every character in the game (Elite Smash not required, but i do recommend starting from 3 or 4 million GSP just so you don't just get cheap wins off of people in 100,000 GSP). 

You start from Mario and end with Mii Gunner (If you haven't made a mii yet, just make three generic miis with no special addons or costumes and delete them after the challenge). If you lose in any way at all, you have to restart from Mario and try again. Losing in an accidental 4 player match or a match with items on will still count as a loss. (Disconnections or if the other player rage quits does not count as a loss, however, your own rage quits do count as losses)

I want to see any opinions on this challenge and if people on the subreddit can accomplish it.",SmashBrosUltimate
Akira Howard (Legionis) for Smash Part 3 of 3,"The Legions have a meter for a total about 20-25 seconds, certain moves or taking damage will benefit opponents since when they take damage the seconds will go down faster. When active switching through Legions they’ll have the same amount of seconds you used them. For example, if the Beast Legion has 23 seconds on it and I use it for 5 seconds and switch to the Axe Legion, I’ll only have 18 seconds for the Beast Legion. The Up Special will be a Joker tether-esque Special. While Joker’s up B outside of Arsene can be aimed diagonally and can grab, Legionis while in Legion mode (except for Beast Legion) can be aimed anywhere and will grab the opponent, it has a slow startup though. The grab of all Legions will be the Auto Bind, wrapping the opponent in chains and keeping them stuck to the ground. This would be the one character with the longest grab range, going half of the stage, something like Pokémon Stadium 2. Aerials will be very swingy, Neutral Air will swing the Legion all around, Forward Air will be sending the Legion out at a range, it’ll go like Simon and Richter’s Side Special, the faster you flick the stick the farther it goes. The same goes for Back Air, Down Air, and Up Air.

Now remember how I didn’t go into base Legionis’ Down Special, here’s how I made things. The Down Special will be Legion Fusion, SPOILERS AHEAD! In the game the protagonist you choose gets the power to fuse with it’s Legion’s core. How it’ll work in Smash will be a semi charge sort of way. Legionis will be put in a special animation for a good few seconds and they’ll become the Fusion. This’ll be active like Joker’s Arsene, it feels like it’ll last forever but it only lasts like 30 seconds. Taking damage will deplete the meter and they’ll un-fuse, this is only available once per stock and when the meter depletes fully, the Legions will be back and fully charged.

Moves, aerials, and grabs for Fusion will be changed as well. Neutral Special will be a charge type move, like Pikachu Side Special. It’ll fly forward give a strong and fast slash. Side Special is Madness Flurry (my own name) giving a feral and wild flurry of slashes. Down Special will be a counter similar to that of Lucario and Greninja, they disappear into the Astral Plane and they reappear in a different direction with a counterattack. Up Special will be Astral Teleport, Fusion Legionis will tear through the air and go in the Astral Plane and reappear like a Mewtwo Teleport. It can be angled obviously.",SmashBrosUltimate

World of Light Nuzlocke idea,"After watching Alpharad’s nuzlocke run throughs in world of light , I wanted to speak out my idea of a nuzlocke. 

This will require you to start in new game plus because it requires all the characters. Sorry for those who haven’t finished it yet. 

Rules: 
The run must be set to the difficult setting. 

For every character that you unlock, bosses you beaten, or 4 star spirts you beaten, you go through a number generator from 1-73 and whatever number it land ons that is the character that is now available for you to use. For example, you unlock Kirby in the beginning so you use the number generator and you get number 50 which is Greninja. So now you can only use Greninja until you get another character which will be after you beat and unlock Mario. After you beat Mario, you go through the number generator and you get number  21 which is Marth so now you can use Greninja and Marth. 

If you lose to a spirit or a boss, the character you used is considered dead. You can revive a dead character by beating any boss in the game like giga bowser, but you lose your chance to get another character through the number generator if you choose to revive one of your fallen characters.  

For spirits, you can only use 1 star spirits until you beat a boss in the light world. After you a beat a boss in the light world you can start using 2 star spirts. After you beat 2 bosses in the light world you can start using 3 star spirits. Once you beat dharkon, you can start using 4 star spirits. (This goes for both main spirits and support spirits). 

Everything in your skill tree must be reset, you cannot use the training areas for your spirits, you do not have access to the shops, and you cannot use the exploration. You can however use training candy to level up your spirits and use the skill tree. 

The nuzlocke ends until you beat galeem and dharkon in the final battle or you have no characters left to continue you nuzlocke. 

So what do you guys think of this nuzlocke idea? Is it too hard or too easy? Is there anything that you think shouldn’t be in there? Is there something I didn’t really specify, if so what is it? Is it too confusing? 

All in all I hope you guys try out this nuzlocke and enjoy it because I definitely plan on trying this out.",SmashBrosUltimate

Rate my school Gamerz Club Smash Tourney rules,"1. Omega Form only

2. No Items, 1 V 1

3. First round must have random characters 

4. User controls

5. 7 Minutes

I’m personally mad about rule 1 and 3. 

My issues with them:

Rule 1: I think the argument that was made was that Omega form was a true test of skill or something and that platforms like in Battlefield were too overcenteralizing? I tried to argue back and say that we should just make it tournament stages (Battlefield, Omega Form, Pokémon Stadium, etc) but I just got outvoted in the end, which just annoyed me even more since the few people who were deciding these rules there don’t even play the game/ own a Switch; and yet they were deciding them for some reason. Not only that, but everyone else was at tutoring (missed the tutoring hours) and we kinda just decided the rules without the other 5-10 people which was even more aggravating.

Rule 3: I honestly believe this rule is stupid and adds an unnecessary layer of luck to the first round. So I can just get eliminated into the losers bracket just like that if I get a character I’m not good with? It punishes those with mains  (I’m presuming they’re doing this to nerf one of my friends who’s a really good shulk main) just because. 

Everything else is fine though.

Currently I approach a match by evaluating my opponents move sets during the first stock phase and begin to see where they are so slow and take advantage of those times using Fox's speed. I watch The damage counter until they hit 100% then move in for an up smash or side smash on the side of the map. I poke with his neutral B projectile when the opponent is far from me. I emphasize nairs and am aggressive in air combat. I try to stick to them like glue and make it a fast paced match.

I am still struggling to make him affective, any tips for playing Fox?

I still have trouble overcoming his reach especially against sword players.

Inkling is a hard match up, I'd love to beat my buddy who plays him.

I'll off handedly play a match as Pikachu and easily beat my friends, Fox though seems to be much harder to do this as. Does he just take more experience?

Thank you!",SmashBrosUltimate
Anyone else wish more victory themes were based on actual victory themes?,"Donkey Kong, Yoshi, all the Pokemon, Ness, Olimar, Villager, Megaman, Ryu, all of these characters have distinct fight won/level complete/whatever accomplished themes that would work great as a victory theme. Despite this, NONE of these characters have these themes in Smash.

For some reason, whoever chooses victory themes has a weird habit of sometimes throwing out the character's original victory theme, and making up a new one, usually a jingle based on an iconic song from that game. I think this is stupid.

I personally think most characters would benefit greatly from having their own actual victory theme as their victory theme. This is really just a personal opinion, but as evidence I present [Yoshi's current victory theme](https://youtu.be/WGfe8BYUHpc) compared to the [Yoshi's Island level complete theme.](https://youtu.be/ZiqwnAI9Yoc) What do you guys think?",SmashBrosUltimate

Advice for getting to excited/too much adrenaline from online play? I can only play like 3 matches before I'm too shaky,"Its really odd. I don't get like this play fighting games with my friends. I don't get this way playing any game on my own. Just this one, and only online play. Doesn't happen for CPUs or training or whatever.

I just can't relax in a match. It triggers some kind of fight or flight response and I'm just hyper focused for way too long. After about 3 matches I have to take a 15-20 minute break cause I'm shaky and my hearts pounding.

So far all I'm really doing is making sure I'm breathing during a match, because I thought maybe its not adrenaline and I'm just so focused I forgot to breathe.

I get that a fighting game isn't supposed to be Stardew Valley levels of relaxation, but I'd like to not be wound up so tightly during a match.

Anyone else suffer similarly or have advice on what to do to combat it? I love this game, but its starting to limit how much enjoyment I can get out of it.",SmashBrosUltimate

Smash ultimate trainning system for future update releases (just some smash brainstorming)," Smash ultimate could use a better training system. I remeber playing this ´´Dojo´´ mode in street fighter 4 mobile (not sure if this mode is available in other versions) and it was a great pleasure tu play and train. You had to complete certain inputs, in order to complete eache stage, from basic to more advanced, and it grew to be a great challenge and it was really rewarding. They really showed you the basic mechanics of the game in a way that felt like a campaign. And out of the basics it was later targeted to each different character. I know smash is technically different but the same principle could be applied.Having the option of creating (user made) stages and control of objects and physics within it might even   
 be something that the community could help make a reality!",SmashBrosUltimate

Controversial opinion: The game would be better with half the cast removed,"Today i was playing as Ganondorf. 2 players i faced stood out to me.
The first one was a samus. Her entire gameplan was to run away and spam side and neutral special. Only after i hang to the ledge for an entire minute was it that she decided to move closer. 0.367 nanoseconds after i pulled up from the ledge she started running away again. After taking 1 stock off of me she ceased trying to kill me and only dodged and zoned. Game timed out. She quit right after.
The entire time i thought one thing: ""I want to fucking kill myself"" 

The second player was a C.Falcon. God do i love that man. We played over 30 matches and despite him winning more often than me, it was the most fun i had with smash in a looong time. We had everything from 3 stocks to last hit situations and even the rare clutch finishes. I had a blast.

Sadly this problem is present across half the characters in the game. So many of them are incredibly frustrating to fight.
Fighting characters like Link, Palutena, Snake, Belmonts is not fun at all. Facing Incineroar, Dedede, Falcon, Fox is so much more fun because you are actually playing Smash Brothers and not touhou (bullet hell game). I actually went and played only snake for 3 weeks. I won much more often and had way less problems with all the annoying marth clones. But it didnt feel like i was playing a fighting game. I was playing a projectile simulator.

Seing how boring that is i went back and picked DeDeDe. I immediatly quit after having to face a Lucina that killed me at 30 by countering an f smash. 

Currently it feels like the only playable characters are those with insane range or absurd combo game where you take 80% cause you get hit by a Nair. 

Everytime i see another ms paint recolor of marth i just want to blow my brains out. Its super SMASH brothers not super SLASH brothers how about you have the decency to actually get anywhere near the person your fighting.

God it's so fucking annoying having to face characters with the same speed and damage but twice the range of your character.

Just take a look at the tierlists. Everyone up there has either a counter, reflector, sword(or other forms of insane range) or projectile. Most of the time multiple of them.

I just want to have a fun time playing a brawler and not a fucking fencing simulator.



All right im done. Queue the idiots not trying to contribute to the discussion shitting their ""git gud"" into the comments, because they don't umderstand that i'm not complaining about the balance of these characters but about the fact that they are not fun to fight.",SmashBrosUltimate

What are your thoughts on the 3 miis ?,"Even if all of them have been used online more or less, not many people seem to talk about them.

Here are my thoughts on the miis:

Mii brawler: 
A very fun to play fast-faller with good combos and decent speed with a huge weakness, his kill options are powerful but unsafe (holy sh** why does f-smash have like 30 frames of end-lag).
He also gets destroyed by projectiles (looking at you belmont bois)
Most people agree on his placement as low to bottom tier, i wish he could get buffed airspeed so he could get close to the opponent easier 

Mii swordfighter:
With the braindead neutral-B to up-air/up-B, this character seems to get a bad reputation.
In my opinion, these options should be nerfed and the rest buffed because he acts like a zoner when he should space out opponents with the sword.
In short, nerf gale-strike and give him more range and frame data.( i could swear his sword got smaller since smash 4) because that stupid combo might be the only reason why he is called viable
But still, those jab-lock chakram combos are really cool

Mii gunner:
No one seems to use this character (It did get a popularity boost from the Sans outfit)
People say that she is just a bootleg version of samus and I don’t really get why.
Is it because of up-smash or charge shot ?
I personally think she is more fun to play than samus because of the different specials wich all have their uses (exept stealth bomb because it’s boring and bad)
She is also the 4th slowest running character in the game and has a lot of end-lag on most of her moves, maybe make her slightly faster in run speed ?

In the end,miis aren’t as much of a joke as they were back in smash 4. I’d like to know what are your opinions on those three.
Do you find them fun and cool to play?
Or do you find them boring and annoying ?

Thank you for reading

Why Minecraft Steve will be the fifth DLC fighter,"So I have a bit of a thesis here, I just want it to be known that the entire rant coming up is 100% unironic.

Let's start with the basics. The next DLC fighter has to be a character that was either A hugely requested in the smash4 DLC Poll or B insanely popular during the early-to-mid development process of Smash ultimate that it doesn't matter that they weren't that big when the poll was still going on. Characters like Terry, banjo and hero fit the former, while Joker fits the latter. So let's look at the four DLC characters already confirmed and see why they got in. Joker is a character that is from a game that is very popular worldwide and on top of this he is from a game that Masahiro Sakurai is a huge fan of. Dragon Quest hero is from one of the most popular video game series in Japan. Banjo and Kazooie is from one of the most popular classic video games in America. Terry Bogard and honestly all of the characters owned by SNK are insanely popular in Latin America. You noticing the trend here? with the exception of Joker each of the characters were insanely popular in a different geographic region. Why isn't Joker catered to a certain region? Well quite simply that's Sakurai's pick. So what regions does that leave? Well you could argue the Middle East but that one's unlikely, same for Africa and india. You could make a better argument for china/Korea considering how popular gaming is in these countries, but most South Koreans and Chinese are more interested in mobile and PC games than they are Nintendo consoles. So that leaves the EU and what is a game that is insanely popular in Europe and has stood the test of time? Minecraft. According to a poll done by Nintendo enthusiast (https://www.nintendoenthusiast.com/2019/09/09/lists-of-most-requested-smash-bros-ultimate-dlc-characters-by-region/) steve is the second most requested character for smash ultimate in Europe. Now, the poll I have shows Sora as the most popular in Europe, America and second place in Japan, but considering Sora is owned by both Disney and Square Enix, the issue being the Big D specifically, it makes things very complicated for him.On top of this well-known fighting game leaker, Vergeben, leaked a lot of accurate information on Smash ultimate, including but not limited to the inclusion of a Square Enix rep, a gen 8 Pokemon that wasn't Decidueye, Ken, Ridley and Daisy. So far the only thing he has gotten wrong, was that the first DLC character would be that Square Enix rep, instead it was the second. Vergeben has stated that there would be something Minecraft related in Smash ultimate. Now, considering the second wave of DLC was almost definitely not conceptualized until after the release of the game, him having this information before the release of the game means that it was either going to be part of the original release or part of the original DLC pack. Meaning one of four things. Option 1, the least likely, multiple sources lied to him about this exact thing. Option 2, there is going to be a Minecraft Mii costume added to the game. Option 3, something Minecraft related was meant to be in the game  but was scrapped very late in development, considering what we've datamined of the game, this is also very unlikely. Lastly, option 4, there is going to be a Minecraft character added to the game. There's also the fact that Mojang, the company that owns Minecraft, is owned by Microsoft, who is now all buddy-buddy with Nintendo. Another vaguely important tidbit is the fact that Minecraft 1.15, which is the current update, is rather small. Now this could be because they are going to be working on these bigger more grandiose updates later, which 1.15 laid the groundwork for or it could be because some of the development team was busy dealing with stuff for smash ultimate. compared to my other points this one is a bit of a stretch admittedly, but I feel as though it still needed to be said. And lastly, going back to my initial point of it either being a character that was very popular during the smash ballot or very popular during the early to mid development of Smash ultimate, Steve checks both of these boxes.

I rest my case",SmashBrosUltimate

What if instead of getting the old Geno Mii Gunner costume back,"We end up getting an updated version of the costume? Look at the Sans costume. It's almost like Sans is in Smash in a way.

It makes sense. Seeing how the Sans costume came with a track, maybe the Geno will come with one too. I honestly believe that the Sans Mii costume was just an appetizer. I personally believe we'll get more of these more detailed Mii outfits in the future. What do all of you think? Feel free to discuss.",SmashBrosUltimate

Cannot buffer upair with tilt stick and help with mario back air,"Whats good friends, i was hoping you guys could help answer some questions for me as im a complete smash noob.

I recently bought a Switch and Ultimate about a week ago after catching some of it at EVO and getting hooked, atm i main Mario, i've been practicing some combos in training mode, short hop aerials, getting used to doing mario's back air when facing opponents and all that jazz.

somebody told me that changing the right joystick to tilts instead of smash attacks was good for combos, so i did and its really helped me a lot, i also changed the right bumper to jump as that made doing back airs much easier as i only need three inputs: **&lt;Lstick + Rbumper + tiltstick&gt;** whereas before i was doing **&lt;Lstick +  X + A + &gt;Lstick.** If anybody knows an easier way of doing mario's back airs or if im doing it wrong pls tell me.

the other thing was with doing upairs using tilt stick, so im practicing doing a mid percent upair combo out of a downththrow but everytime i buffer the upair using the tilt stick for whatever reason mario does a neutral air instead, which makes no sense because you cant normally do a neutral air at all with tilt stick as far as i know, so i either have to buffer using **^Lstick + X + A** or **^Lstick + Rbumper + A** or simply time my tilt stick perfectly as soon as the throw finishes all of which are harder to execute.

Is there an issue with my tilt stick? Is there a setting i dont know about or can you just not buffer upair with tilt stick? Do i just have to do it the other ways? Thanks for the big help boys.",SmashBrosUltimate

There are 74+ characters in Smash Ultimate. I still can't find a main.,"As the title reads, I struggle to find a main. It's honestly really depressing because in a long story short: I mained Chrom, quit for a while, and can't find my footing with him. Rather, I can't even find my footing with anyone. I love a big hitbox Nair, projectiles, Joker's amazing backair, but no matter what I can't stick with them. Either Palutena is just too slow for my liking, characters with projectiles struggle in other areas(i.e to kill with Young Link), and quite honestly I just have too many bad habits with Joker that are hard to get rid of. Wait, Braceboy10, that sounds like you need Fox, right? Well, his gun doesn't stun, and although he feels like the right fit, I can't get the feel for him to play him well. Right now the closest thing I have to a character to main is Shiek, but even then not only is it a struggle to learn all the combos, but it is a struggle to kill. 

That's my small rant. I guess I said all this to just ask: Is anyone like me and figured something out? With 74+ characters I just feel picky, spoiled. But at the same time, I can't ""vibe"" with anyone.",SmashBrosUltimate

**Gameplay Overview :** Midna in her Imp form would be a very light character due to her little form and her floating abilities, being able to use her Hair for lots of uses like Grab enemies from afar, Punch them with a Giant Hair fist, stab people with it as well, or flattening them with a push of the palm of her hair hand, it would most probably be her main weapon as a fighter, but it’s far from being the only thing she use, she can use portals to warp herself through any solid object, can slip in the shadows to surprise enemies from nowhere as well as creating projectile with both her normal hands, and her Hair Hand.

She could become a very frightening character with lots of tools to use in lots of different situations, a “High Risk/High Reward” sort of character, with really powerful moves that have to be used correctly as to not get punished, she also can call on to the Fused Shadows and her ElderLich Form as a final attack.

**Jab :** One attack only, transforming her hair into a giant fist, she threw it at the opponent before pulling it back 

**Forward Tilt :** One quick slap with her giant hand in front of her

**Down Tilt :** Using her hair as a palm this time, she slap directly into the ground with it, grounding opponent touched for a short time

**Up Tilt :** A swipe of her hair, start from the ground in front of her, and do a quick swipe above her

**Dash Attack :** Launch herself forward while punching in front of her, attacking does not stop her dash

**Forward Smash :** She charge up her fist behind her, the more she charge it, the more Purple magic drop of it, (it's a cosmetic effect, charging up just do like every other Smash attacks), and then she release it with one big hit with her hair

**Down Smash :** She partially merge with the shadow, as her hit box become very small and near the ground, she then do one spin with her Hair, hitting first in front of her, and then behind her

**Up Smash :** Using her Magic, she make a pointy rock rise up from the stage, and upward hitting the enemies in the air with this powerful projectile 

**Neutral Aerial :** Her hair take the form of a palm, before doing a quick spin around her, slapping away the enemies near her

**Forward/Back Aerial :** She create a shadow ball in her hand in both case, but use it differently for the Forward and aerial one, for the Forward one, she throw it in front of her, it goes à bit of distance before making a little explosion, it explode before if encountering an enemy, when using her back aerial though, she explode it immediately, making a large hitbox around her back, and propelling her a bit forward

**Up Aerial :** Making her Hand into a Palm form again, she make a big push up her head, if an enemy get hit by this attacks, he won't receive much damage, but will be pushed upward rapidly, the knock back increase very slightly with damage, but it always push pretty high

**Down Aerial :** Using her magic, she make a drill kick straight down while laughing, she isn't able to stop herself mid way, and it's a pretty fast, multi hit attacks that will drag down the enemy with you 

**Grab :** She use her hand to grab the enemy, after that she just stand lazely as the Hand either constrict to deal damage (Pummel), or throw the enemy violently in one direction (Throw) 

**Neutral Special :** Using her Hand as a palm, she start charging up a big orb of Dark Energy, she cannot move while she is charging it up, but she can keep the charge by rolling or dodging, when throwing it she throw it right at her feet causing a big explosion, the more charged it is, the bigger the explosion is, and the more damage it deal, those hitted only by the explosion will take less damage than the one that got caught by the orb throw and the explosion 

**Side Special :** A Special type of command grab, she will stretch her hair in the direction chosen, and will grab any enemies her hair meet, she will then stretch her hair back to her, and throw the enemy in one direction, by pressing the button a second time, the grabbing hand will change into a fist, dealing good amount of damage and of knock back in the direction the fist is going, she cannot move while using this move and cannot cancel it in the middle of it either

**Up B :** Midna create a warp portal and use it to teleport up her current location, she cannot be hitted when teleporting, but the Teleport cannot be aimed, it will only go up, the Teleport pass through solid object, but will always teleport in the air, it isn't possible to recover directly on a platform, her teleport does not have a hurt box, but she do not get into free fall mod after the warp

**Down B :** When using this move, a start up animation start where Midna slowly slip into the platform and in the shadows, she is hittable during the beginning of this attack even if her hitbox shrink down into the platform during it, once inside the shadows, she is invincible for a little bit of time, she is visible by a clear shadow on the platform (just like Greninja's), once the timer is up, she get back from the shadow and attack the nearest enemy, if no enemy is near her at that moment, she simply slip back to the stage

**Final Smash :** The Fused Shadow appear around her as she suddenly transform, anyone touched by her Spider Form limbs get sended into an animation where Midna, in this new Beastial form, unleash a brutal combo with her Giant Spear, if no one get touched, the Fused Shadow simply parts away, leaving Midna in her normal form again

**Taunt :**

\-Up Taunt have her reaching her hand out, making the Fused Shadows appear, she look at them, before wrapping them away and laughing 

\-Side Taunt have her making the Ordon Shield and Sword appear, the Shield on her head as a mask, and the sword back handed, she give a quick swing, before pulling the items away

\-Down Taunt have her extending her hair into a palm, before sitting on it and laughing, then coming back to her normal stand

**Idle Animation :** 

\-Midna pull off the Twilight Thorn, playing a bit with it in her hand, before pulling it away 

\-She start levitating in a laying down position as she start to hum the first few notes of her theme",SmashBrosUltimate
Looking for a sparring partner,"I'd love to improve, and you can only get so far playing against level 9s all the time. I also think the online service and matchmaking sevice provided by Nintendo is inconsistent, and frustrating.

Tips to Designing Deoxys,"After talking with friends and making some choices, I’ve come to a conclusion that Deoxys would make a good fighter for Smash Bros. All I need to do now is come up with a moveset… and I want your guys’ help with it. 

I know that this character would have a gimmick where it switches between its four forms: Normal, Attack, Defense, and Speed. All of these forms would behave differently.

Normal: Average character.
Attack: Does More Damage, But takes more Damage.
Defense: Takes less Damage and knockback, But falls faster.
Speed: lighter and moves faster, but takes more knockback.

Other than that, I’m drawing nothing but blanks.",SmashBrosUltimate

Adding a short hop button + right and left grab controls,"What do you all think of adding the extra control options above?

Thoughts on the Soul series' Nightmare as DLC?,"For your consideration:  
  
* Nightmare's first Nintendo appearance was in the Gamecube version of *Soulcalibur II* where he was playable alongside Link. It's been seventeen years, give Link and Nightmare the rematch they deserve.
* On a similar note, Cloud Strife was originally going to be playable in the Playstation version of *Soulcalibur II*. The deal fell through at the last minute and I don't know about you but I still want to see Cloud and Nightmare duke it out. SSBU could make that happen.
* Nightmare also appeared in *SoulCalibur Legends*, a Wii exclusive. That was his second and most recent Nintendo appearance.
* He's a Namco character like Pac-man. Bandai-Namco's already the lead developer of SSBU, they could totally make a *Soul* series character happen.
* I know some people would argue *Tekken* is the Namco property that would be more likely to contribute a DLC character. That's a fair prediction but if you ask me another martial artist like Heihachi will just kind of blend in with Little Mac, Ryu, Ken, and now Terry. Nightmare has some more obvious special moves to suit SSBU's flashy gameplay.
* I suppose by that logic you could accuse Nightmare of being just another sword guy but at least he's not another blue-haired anime kid. Not that there's anything wrong with that.
* Speaking to the uniqueness he could bring to the roster, he's a solid villain. Smash could always use more bad guys considering there's about one playable villain for every seven or eight heroes. That would also make the *Soul* series the first series in Smash to be solely represented by a villain (unless you count Wario as one?)
* Why Nightmare and not another *Soul* series character? He's one of the popular ones who's neither generic (like Mitsurugi or Xianghua) or oversexualized (like Taki, Sophitia, or obviously Ivy). Plus he's the wielder of Soul Edge, the primary driving force behind the whole narrative of the series. Also Nightmare's the dude on the Project Soul logo so if there's gonna be any face to represent the series it's gonna be his ugly mug. 
* Nightmare's on the edgier side but if Nintendo just downplays the whole ""blood and slaughter"" thing while focusing on the ""darkness and souls"" thing they should be able to skate by just fine.  
  
So what do you think? Any *Soulcalibur* fans out there who'd be stoked for this?",SmashBrosUltimate

Why do people hate Overwatch?,"Genuine question, why are people so adamant about not having an overwatch hero in smash? 

I get the game has gone down hill over the years but it's still one of my most played games and I have plenty of fond memories of the game as well as the diverse characters.

Regarding the Overwatch Hate,"I might be a bit late on this, but I don't like seeing how adamant some smash fans can be about certain characters and such in smash. This is coming from someone's who hasn't played overwatch at all. My opinion would likely pale in comparison to someone who has, but I don't really get all the hate around an overwatch character in smash. It seems like a lot of the hate is *super* biased, and for what reason(s) why is something I'd like to know.

I truly do want to know why those of you who are opposed to an addition of an OW character in smash to tell me why, with your bias for overwatch out of the way, you think it would be bad for smash, and perhaps the smash community as well.
Now the reason why I say “bad for smash”, is because I feel as if a lot of the smash community who love and appreciate the game, see it as a celebration of video game history. Hell, even outside of the community, it's one way of interpreting, or having an idea what smash is really all about now. I, myself, would not be able to explain why overwatch would be a good addition to that celebration, I just simply don't know enough about overwatch, but that's another one of the reasons why I'm making this post. I want to learn about this whole thing, and more, while also hopefully, and more importantly, having the people of this community discussing, and sharing their thoughts, and opinions on this topic. 

On the basis mentioned earlier, do you think an overwatch character would be a good addition to smash ultimate? Why, or why not?",SmashBrosUltimate

Why I think Amaterasu is a great chiice for the final fighters pass slot,"Now there has been a lot of leaks as always about whose going to be the next fighter but I want to step back from that for now and do some basic deductions here. Any one could be on the table has a fighter so why is my money on Amaterasu. Well for one she is the one I want in the game, the fighter that is the dream option for me. So let's talk about her chances, Okami is a game that has an interesting place in gaming and exists like Firefly does for tv shows, something most people in the community know about and deem with high regards even with the lack of content released for the series. This cements the game as a semi - cult classic. The fanbase for the game despite being kind of small is very vocal in the gaming world and the game itself was praised by critics. Another thing in Ammy's case is the fact she is owned by capcom and while some people think the demon hunter or the lawyer are more likely I would like to point out what has been said about making unique fighters. Dante would play to much like bayo and wright is kind of a joke fighter due to streches that would have to me made for a moveset. That leaves us with Amaterasu a fighter who has a gimic which nintendo loves. She uses ink pots to perform her celestial brush moves and that could translate well into smash as well has the use of the reflector on her back. The game itself is on the switch is honestly at this point means nothing but it should be brought up. There has also been a lack of female represention in the fighters pass and while that may not originally been an issue with nintendo there have been people on the extreme poltical side of viewing it has anothe opresion of women. Therefore inserting a female rep would make sense. All in the game itself is so stunning that music and stage would fit right in to the ever expanding universe of smash. So what do y'all think is she a likely pick or am I just dumb and want someone whose not making it in ever.",SmashBrosUltimate

I love that smash is branching out to every game and everyone one I'm not upset he's in smash, I'm upset at how unfun he turned out to be. Even playing him I just feel dirty. His combos are pretty simple with and without Arsen, he has good projectiles especially his down b which is a headache on it's own, his grab and grapple hook are absurd, and for me it never feels justified winning as him.

"My Links Overhaul Ideas (Post Series, Links in Comments)","People get super antsy about clone characters, and for a good reason. Sometimes, the character doesn't bring enough new to the table to warrant anything more than a skin, but they are made a full fighter for one reason or another. The Emblem characters are the best examples, as 4 of the 7 characters play almost exactly the same, and almost al of them share attacks and gameplay styles. The Links are another example, as they all play the same.

******WHY******

While, yes they are all Link, they are all very distinct compared to the difference between Marth and Roy. Saying that every Link is the same is like say that the Zelda series stars Zelda. It just isn't true. Every Link, while sharing the name, is completely unique from one another, having different items, characteristics, and fighting styles. Having all 3 links play the same is just lazy and hurts what is a very interesting and unique part of the zelda series that could easily be represented through gameplay just by making each link distinct from one another.

To avoid posting a column of text, I'll split this into 3 posts and link (Haha fuuny) them below so you can check each one out. I really don't like splitting it up, because then people might not see it all, but no one would want read more than past here in a single post anyway",SmashBrosUltimate

My Links Overhaul Ideas 1: BOTW Link,"Breath of the Wild's version of Link found himself in a world torn apart by Calamity Ganon, lacking any strength and memories.  Instead of running headfirst into danger, Link had to master the elements of nature to survive the harsh Hyrulian wasteland and defeat the monsters that plagued the remaining peices of humanity. 

Likewise, Link would play very tactically, having an emphasis on game awareness, resources management, and learning how to deal with you opponent. He would use the game's various runes as special attacks, and he would use a wide variety of weapons for his attacks. His moveset should also reflect the resource management that heavily effected the gameplay of BOTW

Here are some ideas:

All attacks: Link now uses a mixture of swords, spears, and axes in his moveset. These attacks will provide longer or stronger attacks on some moves like f-tilt and b-air

Neutral Special: Ancient Bow. This bow can switch between three arrow types: Regular, Lightning, and Bomb. Regular Arrows will fly through almost anything, and provide a good bit of chip damage. Instead of Regular Arrows making you flinch, lightning arrows will now fulfill that purpose. Bomb arrow will also replace the bomb as Link's main explosive. The main gimmick of BOTW Link's bow is that you only get a few of each arrows each match. Whenever you fire an arrow, you will need retrieve them to keep your supplies up. If you run out of arrows, you will need to take a stock to get more. This helps to bring over some of the game-awarness, inventory management, and resource collection aspects of BOTW.

Side Special: Cyronis Pillar: Creates a barrier between you you opponent. Can be used to launch opponents upward. Great for giving Link extra time to plan and collect arrows

Down Special: Stasis Counter. Freezes opponents in time. Either hit them to increase the knockback they receive or retreat and plan your next attack. Note that this is a counter move and can only be used as a counter and not a normal special move

Up Special: Ravali's Gale/Paraglide. While I wish Link could either use all of the champion's abilities, this is the only one that works with smash's gameplay. Does exactly what it does in BOTW, but can be activated anywhere and much quicker. If you just tap Up B, you can glide without using Ravali's gale. 

Sheild: Daruk's Protection. When you initiate a perfect shield, your enemy will be hurt and be sent away slightly. Unlikely, as unique shield are not a thing FOR SOME REASON

These changes should help make BOTW Link stand out as a representative of BOTW and not just zelda. His gameplay was new and completely unique among all of the zelda games, and it really should have been implemented into his moveset in smash. Not having Link have his own unique BOTW moveset is a massive mistake considering all of the new and unique ideas BOTW bring to the zelda franchise",SmashBrosUltimate

My Links Overhaul Ideas 2: Yink/Young Link,"Majora's Mask it a fan favorite zelda game because of its incredible story and unique gameplay elements. While it would be impossible to replicate Majora's story in smash, you could add in the unique gameplay elements.

Here are some of my ideas

Transformations: Yinks entire moveset would have him quickly transforming into each of the 4 forms of link. Instead of the long transition between transformations in MM, the transformations in smash would be made instantly with as little animation time as possible in order to avoid confusion with things like positioning. While Yink does transform often, he will always turn back into young link when he is finished performing a move. This would be a massive transition from current Yink, as the transformations would add much better flexibility and much more versatility at the cost of having slower attacks

Down B: Goron Curl: Roll out but good. Goron Link charges a roll that is very fast and can be jumped out of. The curl will break if your opponent shields

Side B: Zora Charge: Zora Link charges forward with a crashing wave. The wave does low damage but has a large hitbox with good knockback

Up B: Deku Glide: Deku Link burrows into a deku flower and blast upwards. He can attack forward and behind him while gliding",SmashBrosUltimate

"My month in Elite Smash, AKA: a diary of spamming missiles",[deleted],SmashBrosUltimate
My Month in Elite Smash; AKA: A Diary of Wasting Time,"**My month in Elite Smash; a completely useless, unscientific, and masturbatory study:**

On the day Banjo and Kazooie was released, I decided to start keeping track of every battle result in Elite Smash, in which my only character is Samus. Didn't count any results from other characters I played, nor any tournaments entered—JUST Elite Smash battles as Samus. Some interesting results revealed themselves!

**Scientific(??) observations:**

—GSP at this level is actually HIGHLY correlated with win probability. A difference of even 10-20k in GSP would probably weight the match to about a 60% chance of victory for the higher rated player, all else being equal (that is to say, particular character matchup strength notwithstanding).

—Where a character lands in a ""tier"" list, on the other hand, has little bearing on their likelihood to win any particular match. Tier lists are basically only useful or relevant in professional-level competition, in my opinion. For example, the book says that I should beat Little Mac every time, but I faced some really good ones! (And fucked up a couple times) So I went 4-3 against them.

—Heavy characters, for whatever reason, are much more likely to rematch, even when highly outclassed. I don't know why, but many heavies, especially Ganondorf, seem to have constant hope that next time...NEXT TIME!!!...they'll get me! Hence, the disproportionate number of Bowser, DK, and Ganondorf matches.

—If you face someone of approximately equal skill and beat them in the first match, the optimum number of additional times to play them to maximize your winning percentage is just 1. Anything beyond 2 total games, and you get comfortable with what's working, and your opponent starts to figure you out; those two factors combine to dramatically drop your chances of winning further. Obviously, if you split the first two games, you should play a third, because if you leave with 1 win apiece, you're a worthless, shameful coward who can't handle rubber matches.

—New characters have an advantage at first. My record against Banjo and Kazooie was something like 5 wins against 10 losses early in the month; by the end, it was 30-16.

—Only 2 characters showed up zero times: Corrin, and Dark Samus. So sad :-(

—The absolute most painful characters to face for me as Samus are Rosalina, Pac-Man, Olimar, and Simon/Richter. Lots of other characters are bad matchups, sure (Villager, Isabelle, Game n Watch, Wolf, etc), but those 5 make my stomach drop when I see them.

**Some footnotes and awards:**

Most matches without a loss: Lucas, 14

Most matches without a Victory: Olimar, 4

Most matches with a .500 record: Joker, 18 (9 wins, 9 losses)

Most surprising winning record: Game n Watch, 6-2

Most surprising losing record: Ridley, 4-10

Most legitimately worthless character to play as, in my personal, unprofessional opinion: Kirby

Most likely to be mained by people who want other people to suffer and are probably psychotic sadists: Sonic

Most annoying spammer bullshit: Three-way tie: Duck Hunt, Snake, Samus (Yes, that includes me)

Most underplayed character that is actually pretty good: Wii Fit Trainer

Most overplayed character that actually isn't very good: Ryu/Ken

Most satisfying character to kick their fucking teeth in: Ness

Overall record: 462-225 (67.25% wins)

Who I believe the final Fighters Pass character will be,"I've talked about what characters I think would be DLC for Smash, but I've not really speculated about the final character in the Fighters Pass. I have said that I would love a certain character, like Rayman to be the final character in the Fighters Pass, but I've never really said who I think it is for sure. Just by looking at some things that have been said by certain companies, and by what Nintendo has been bringing to the Switch, I'm very confident that the final Fighters Pass character is Doom Slayer (or Doomguy). The reason why is simple. Bethesda has said in past that they have spoken with Nintendo about Smash Ultimate. Someone asked this to Pete Hines, the vice president of PR and marketing on twitter and they simply said yeah. Oh yeah, in fact. Plus, Nintendo has been giving us a ton of Doom games on the Switch. We got (and are getting) the first Doom, Doom 2, Doom 3 BFG Edition, Doom 2016, Doom Eternal, Doom 64. I'd be surprised if Doom wasn't represented somehow in Smash. Heck, Doom being one of the oldest first person shooters out there maybe that could be worked into a moveset somehow. I don't know, I've never played Doom. All I can say is that it seems like we might get something from Bethesda. If it isn't Doom Slayer I don't know who it could be (maybe Vault Boy). For right now my money is Doomguy.",SmashBrosUltimate

Smash DLC Trailer Concepts,"Doom Slayer: (Similar to the Ness trailer leak) Ness and Lucas are flung away from the camera. It then cuts to Porky in his machine lurching towards the heroes with the final boss version of Giygas in the background. Porky then launches one of the claws toward the heros to finish the job, but then... A gunshot destroys the arm AND the claw. It cuts to Porky in the machine looking at who shot the claw with his teeth clenched in anger. It then cuts to a boot stepping out of the shadows before a slow camera crawl up to see the Doom Slayer. He points his shotgun at Porky before the splashscreen appears, *""Doom Slayer brings the eternal pain!""* 

&amp;#x200B;

Morrigan (Darkstalkers): Ness and Lucas catch their breath with the Doom Slayer standing next to them. The Doom Slayer then hears a noise before whipping his shotgun to the source of the noise, with Ness and Lucas looking confused. A voice then breaks the silence, ""Ooh, the Doom Slayer... I've heard you can slay demons..."" the voice says as the camera moves towards it, ""But can you slay... A succubus?"" Morrigan then steps out of the shadows before the splashscreen appears, *""Morrigan stalks the competition!""*

&amp;#x200B;

Crash Bandicoot: The trailer begins with Sonic running through a familiar looking jungle. He continues to run before being stopped by a familiar bad guy, Dr. Neo Cortex. Cortex says, ""Well look what we have here! One of my animal super soldiers escaped! ""What? I don't even know what your talking about... Or who you are..."" Sonic says. ""Well, you'll see soon enough..."" He says before Tiny Tiger, Dingodile, Ripper Roo, Dr. Nitrous Brio, N. Gin, and N. Tropy hop out of the bushes, closing in on Sonic. ""Heh, some stupid bad guys ready for me to bash? Well, guess it's time to party!"" (Reference to Sonic Battle) The bad guys leap in for the kill before an orange blur rushes in and takes care of all of them in a flash. ""Man..."" Sonic says sadly, ""I wanted to beat 'em up... But, I am glad to see a old friend... Crash..."" He says as it cuts to Crash as he looks at the screen, doing the last part of the Crash dance. The trailer ends with Sonic and Crash doing the Crash dance.

First of all, I'm not just repeating what everyone else is saying, that the ""the smash community is bad, and will talk shit about any character that isn't what they wanted"".

Can't people just ignore an character that they don't like instead of creating shit arguments about why it shouldn't be in smash?

My thoughts on improving Hero,"I think everyone in the competitive scene agrees that Hero needs some kind of rework, regardless of their reasoning. Some see him as a mediocre character that needs buffs just to function properly at a high level, some think his level of RNG has no place in the competitive scene, whilst casual players see him as game-breaking (as much as I disagree, I've seen too many posts likening him to Smash 4 Bayonetta/Brawl MK). So, for various reasons, many want Hero to have some changes. These are my thoughts on the matter.

I've seen many calls for removing a lot of spells from Hero, but there are only a handful I find worthy of straight up deleting. I would delete Hocus Pocus, first and foremost. I enjoy playing Hero, but I'll be honest. I never use this move unless I'm absolutely bodying my opponent and have nothing to lose for doing so. Sure, there are some amazing things that can happen. but the likelihood of them is slight compared to the negative. I'll break it down for the sake of those who don't want to search things up, but [here](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Command_Selection#Hocus_Pocus_Effects) is a link to the list of effects and percentages. Put simply, you have a 36% chance of a negative effect, a 10% chance to get a positive effect, a 6% chance of turning invisible (regarded as neutral by the wiki), and the rest is divided up as a chance to get one of the other command selections (using 4 MP as opposed to whatever its cost is). There is no point in using this spell while you're ahead by a slight margin, because the negative effects not only have a higher likelihood, but have a higher propensity for causing instant stock loss (snooze, timer, loss of all MP). Using it when you're behind also is less of a guarantee and the slingshot mechanics for it don't necessarily counterbalance the risk of using it. Opinions on the move aside, I think it's too much RNG for a tournament setting, and removing it completely would address that issue and buff Hero in the sense that he would be more likely to get other (arguably more useful) commands.

The only other moves I would remove from command selection are Kaclang and metal slash. These moves have no point and are a waste of a command selection slot. Metal slash is useless outside of the ditto, and in the ditto, Kaclang is useless since it's basically a free stock for your opponent. When standing next to a metal opponent, metal slash is 4 times as likely to appear in the command menu. So, in general, just removing these two would buff Hero in the same sense I mentioned previously - this would make the other commands appear more frequently.

Last but not least (for the command selections) I would slightly alter Whack and Thwack. I don't think they should be removed, but adjusted a bit. For a base reference, [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/9pMHo4yhRpuX8KvC8) is an image that details the breakdown of the death spells' percentage of success in relation to the opponent's and Hero's percents. The changes I would make would be slight, but I think would have a pretty significant impact. Instead of being a 1% chance to kill with both at 0 (and various other percent combinations), I would take the lowest possible percent Hero could kill at without crits or buffs (roughly 20-30% with a well-spaced f-smash?), have the percentages start there, and be 0% chance of success before that. I would still have it cap at the same percentages it currently does (when opponent is at 160%, you have a 100% chance to kill if it lands). This would require a re-scaling of the success rate function, but I think would allay some of the RNG complaints. If you could die to a non-crit f-smash at the percent you were at, that's at least a little better than dying at 0 (and this would be a low probability of success, to boot).

That is all I would effectively change for the command menu. Now onto the rest of his moveset. Here, I think he needs more direct buffs as opposed to what he needed for the command menu changes. I'll list them by move, and try to explain my rationale for each. If I don't touch on a move, I think it is fine as is and needs no changes (or general changes that are at the end).

Up special: In general, I think this move is fine. It covers a pretty good distance, but is not the perfect recovery in the sense that it is very vulnerable. However, I would make one slight alteration. Make Hero able to act after being launched (similar to Bowser Jr., Sonic, Mega Man, etc.). The angle and speed it sends you at basically makes it a free punish, even if you recover optimally. Being able to, for example, air dodge after launching yourself would help vary the angles from which you can safely recover and make you less vulnerable to edge guards. You would still be vulnerable, but it would make it less free, and I think that's a buff Hero desperately needs.

Up smash: This move is border line useless unless you combo into it with dair at specific percents, you're on a stage with platforms, or you're in 2v2s where you can combo into it. Please, for the love of god, give him a scooping hitbox on the ground like every other sword character in this game. People can literally run into you while you're performing this move and you'll still not hit it. That is ridiculous and definitely needs buffing.

Up tilt: Make this move a better combo starter/perhaps combo into itself more reliably at lower percents? Similar to the Links and other sword characters. This move is pretty decent as an anti-air, but there's less incentive to use it in favor of heavier punishes, even at low percent.

Down tilt: Reduce KBG. This would make it a more consistent combo tool and I think that would help him a lot in general. As is, it helps combo in a specific percent window, and then is basically useless after that.

Up air: Please, please delete this move and replace it with a better one. Even considering its capacity to combo at low percent, this move is so small and bad. And it's not even fast enough to compensate. Ideally, I would like something like Chrom or Ike's up air. It fits him way better and would have way more utility. Especially if you could do the Ike and combo into it from nair. Really, this isn't a super realistic criticism since they've never actually changed an entire move before. This is more venting than anything else lol.

Neutral air: I definitely feel like this move needs its size increased. Other than that, I think it's generally fine. This move constantly trades with non-disjointed hitboxes and that is not really okay imo. 

Back air: Either: increase the speed/reduce landing lag with the same strength, or keep the speed/landing lag and increase its strength. As is, it's a decent move, but not really as good as it should be.

Down air: Again, I feel like a slight size increase would be justified here. It's a pretty solid spike, but unless you're playing someone with a recovery that's free, it's pretty tricky to line up. I'm not thinking in the vein of making it Falcon/Ganon dair-sized or anything. Just a slight buff to make it a bit easier to land.

That's all for the move-specific changes I think he needs, but lastly I would propose some general changes to him. Canonically, in his games, Hero is slightly above average in all categories, making him a very good party member. He's quick, but not the fastest. Strong, but not a heavy-hitter like some characters. So, in general, to bring him in line with this, a few small changes are necessary. Buff his run/air speed slightly. Reduce end/landing lag on his smashes and aerials. They have a lot of start-up and I feel that is enough of a handicap to compensate for their strength. Buff his grab range. It's the shortest in the game, and for a character with grab combos, that sucks. A lot. Last thing, give him ONE quick option. His fastest moves are jab and up air, tied at frame 6. There are characters that have smash attacks faster than that. As a sword character, he doesn't need anything crazy fast, but at least give him one move that's like...frame 3 or 4. Preferably the buffed down tilt I mentioned previously, but it doesn't have to be. Jab would do. Ftilt would do.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've read this far, thanks for taking the time. If you don't care about my personal reasons for wanting these changes, you can be done here. A reminder to all to please be civil in the comments; I'm completely open to civilized debate on the subject.

I propose these changes NOT as a Hero main, but as a long time Dragon Quest fan. Hero is literally my wet dream smash character. DQ8's Hero was someone I voted for in the Smash 4 fighter ballot. I can't possibly convey to you in words how moved I was when his reveal trailer dropped. I got a little teared up when I saw his trailer, honestly. To make things even better, I actually kind of like the way he feels and plays. If he got these buffs, I could seriously justify maining him.

It also makes me incredibly sad that his inclusion has sparked such controversy and vitriol in the fan base, since one of Smash's hallmarks is introducing players to games they may not have heard of. I know that prior to Melee, many western fans did not know of Fire Emblem. Prior to Joker's inclusion, many people didn't know of (or care about) Persona. I've loved Dragon Quest since I was like 10 or 11, so the thought that Smash could introduce new fans to the series made me genuinely, truly happy. But as of now, his inclusion is reduced to salty memes (on both sides), heated exchanges, and preemptive (and imo, premature) calls for a ban. 

Positions on it aside, I look forward to any discussion we may have.",SmashBrosUltimate

[Unpopular Theory] SNK Leak Language Theory,"Some are saying that the leak couldn't have been made by mistake since there are many other languages with the same mistake, but here's the thing... Each and every single copyright box is the very same, even in other languages.

The only thing that seems to change only, is the trademark. I'll show you an example:

**Challenger Pack 4.**

**(Here goes info about the content of the DLC in question)**

This area is made manually and translated manually as well. Before the leak, it was surely translated alright.

**TOS, displaying everything about technology protection measures, product cancel policy, etc.**

This is automatically copy-pasted... SNK Heroines appears just like this.  Exactly the same. Since it is copy-pasted, this is automatically translated as well, perhaps by script according to the language selected for the Nintendo page.

**\*Insert Trademark here\***

Manually done, could have been copy-pasted along with the TOS since they are in the same box, if the Trademark has a ""insert relevant trademark here"" label. This requires no translation whatsoever, it will appear English in every language because it has no need to be translated.

Once everything manual is done, it is submitted (At this point, the guy who did this may have left SNK trademark by accident instead of using the commonly used huge amount of trademarks Smash uses). The script translates the TOS automatically according to Nintendo's language and that would be it.

I don't know, guys... But if the leak was indeed real, there would have been heads rolling at NOA and even leakers would hear about it.

Up to you guys if you want to disprove it by another DLC TOS information used as copy-paste from the same page, then I'll concede my theory completely debunked.

TL;DR:  
1- Title and Body of DLC is manually typed and translated.  
2- TOS is automatically pasted, as well as automatically translated by script.  
3- Trademark is manually added, no translation required. Being in the same  box as TOS, it could have grounds for mistake in a copy-paste.

Just giving hope for those who want their chars in, I apologize. I just think SNK has already enough representation from other games. Let others have their time, would you?

Arsene is overrated,"I’ve been playing Joker since the day he came out long before any drama surrounding him and before Leo started dominating with him. I laughed at the idea of Joker being “broken” due to how obviously not broken he is and assumed anyone who says he is was not being serious. It seems like I’m the only person in online play who doesn’t run away from arsene when another Joker player has him out arsene just doesn’t scare me at all. I am extremely comfortable with playing without arsene out and often prefer to not have him out because I like the grapple hook better than the wings. It is beyond irritating to me when people run away from me when arsene is out I get he’s does more damage with arsene but you run away from him like he’s super broken and that’s just not the case and I’m just like “ok fine I’ll wreck you without arsene then, pussy”. 

Btw why does everyone always call for a nerf whenever one top player does well with a new character as if his talent is relevant to the average player?

Attended my first tournament today,"My local college (which I am enrolled in) held a tournament today and I’d been planning on attending for weeks. I was super excited, and my brother was too (he participated with me) the event was open to all, but free for students at the college. Call me shallow, but I immediately judged the players there not by their skill, but by their outward appearance. Every single person I fought had some sort of physical deformity/horrible hygiene. Hell, everyone at the tournament looked messed up, like they’d just come out of hibernation in their parent’s basement. The first fight was supposed to be newbies vs newbies, but the dude I was supposed to fight dropped, and I was set to fight another newbie. I was shocked, however, to learn that my new opponent had attended, and won, numerous tournament before. Strangely enough, I barely scraped by two wins against him, and lost against the second dude, which put me in the losers bracket. Here, my opponent was a plushie-obsessed, massively overweight man-child, who screamed the F word when he lost the first round. He got me in the second and third round, which threw me from the tournament.

"Terry Bogard may be coming to Smash. Here's why he's awesome, what Fatal Fury and SNK are, and why they're important to gaming as a whole.","If you don't know who SNK is, they're a Japanese video game company who develop and publish games like Fatal Fury, Samurai Shodown, King of Fighters, Art of Fighting, and Metal Slug. With all of these franchises being Fighting games besides Metal Slug, this genre is at the heart and soul of SNK. SNK as a company embodies the 90s era of the arcade scene. They dominated the arcades, grocery stores, gas stations, etc with their powerful NEO GEO arcade cabinets. Full of colorful bombastic games with flashy visuals, jazzy and rock and roll OSTs, and over the top characters. SNK is a huge part of gaming history that has unfortunately been forgotten by most American audiences, however the fanbase is still enormous in Latin America and China. The idea that SNK doesn't deserve a rep is silly to me.

Their first fighting game was Fatal Fury, released the same year as Street Fighter II in 1991, and featured Terry Bogard as its main character, as well as his arch nemesis and final boss, Geese Howard. Fatal Fury continued to release titles, culminating in the flashy and gorgeous Real Bout Fatal Fury 2, the best of the classic Fatal Fury series. The finale to the franchise was 1999's Garou: Mark of the Wolves, set in the future with a grown up Terry and a cast of ten other brand new fighters. The game had beautiful animation unlike anything fighting games had ever seen, crisp gameplay, an outstanding OST, and amazing character designs. One of which was Rock Howard, the son of the late Geese Howard, raised by Terry, so he has a fighting style that mixes that of the main hero and villain of the series.

SNK's most popular franchise is the Kingof Fighters. It's a crossover fighting game, featuring characters prominently from Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting. It also includes characters from Ikari Warriors, Psycho Soldier, and SNK's sports games. In addition, it adds brand new characters exclusive to the KOF series, such as the famous rivals Kyo and Iori, which are fan favorites as much as Terry, Rock, and Mai. This is the series that introduced me to Terry. Speaking of..

Terry Bogard is an american caricature character in the 2nd oldest fighting game franchise of all time, Fatal Fury. Street Fighter II is slightly older. He also appears in SNK's crossover tag team fighting game series, the King of Fighters. 

He speaks in American colloquialisms and catchphrases. ""Hey, c'mon c'mon!"" ""Okay!"" 

He uses a mix of street brawling, kung fu, and ki manipulation. He has very cool special moves.

Power Wave is his projectile. He punches the ground, shouts ""Powaaa Wave!"", and a golden energy wave travels along the ground.

Burn Knuckle is a falcon kick type of attack. He simply flies forward with a blue or golden flaming fist, shouting ""BURN KNUCLKLE"". The light version is instant and travels a short distance, and the heavy version has significant windup and travels fullscreen.

Rising Tackle is his anti air move. It's an upwards drill kick, soaring high into the air. ""Rising Tacku!"" Samus' up air was likely inspired by this move.

Crack Shoot is an overhead special move, a jumping axe kick. He also shouts the name of the move.

Power Dunk is another anti air. He shoulders or knees upwards to launch his opponent, and then jumps up and dunks them back down with his flaming fist. ""Powa dunk!""

He has two famous super moves. Power Geyser is Terry punching the ground like Power Wave, but it shoots out like a diagonal energy geyser from the ground. He has a variation where he punches the ground three times to produce three geysers. ""Powa.. GEYSAH!""

His most famous move is Buster Wolf, my favorite of his special moves. Before the move starts he shouts, ""ARE YOU OKAY?"" He then does a huge fullscreen energy punch, and if it connects, he pumps his fist forward to produce a huge multihit energy wave, shouting ""BUSTAH WUUUULF!""

He starts matches by adjusting his hat and motioning for his opponent to approach. ""Hey, c'mon c'mon!""

His most famous victory screen is him throwing his cap across the screen as he turns his back to the camera, shouting ""OKAY!""

His normals are very similar to someone like Ken, only less martial artsy in style, and more similar to a street brawler. Think somewhere between Ken and Captain Falcon.

Terry is the mascot of SNK, and is so bursting with character and is a very flashy and fun character to use. He's definitely the fan favorite. His moveset basically writes itself. While not a mechanically unique character, he's a unique personality with iconic and flashy moves that I'm sure will capture the hearts of smash fans everywhere when he's revealed.",SmashBrosUltimate

I made a moveset for Goomba because some guy in the comments told me to,"#Goomba Stomps the competition!

#General Design:

Goomba is a weak fighter, at least until its gimmick comes into play. A Goomba main wants to ""Walk up slowly and down smash"" or something similar. Goomba's aerials are especially terrible, but it's still better than Mac. 

#Ground Attacks:

**Jab:** Goomba performs a simple one-two kick, one with each foot. An unimpressive jab, this isn't a move you'll see much in play.

**F-Tilt:** Goomba kicks in front of itself. While similar to its jab, f-tilt has a larger range and does more damage. 

**Up Tilt:** Goomba headbutts upward. This move has very low priority, meaning Goomba is very easy to hit from the air. Get it? It's the funny stompy thing! Yay!

**D-Tilt:** Goomba dives forward, covering a decent amount of ground. This move has surprisingly low endlag, letting Goomba dive around the stage. 

**F-Smash:** Goomba launches itself at the opponent feet-first in a weaker impression of Bowser's f-smash. Funnily enough, it hits below the ledge. 

**Up Smash:** Goomba does a flip, hitting enemies with its feet. Only the feet have hitboxes, giving the move a tipper-like quality.

**Down Smash:** Goomba does a split which functions similarly to Jigglypuff's down smash.

#Aerial Attacks:

**N-Air:** Goomba spins midair, hitting opponents on all sides. This move does very little damage, but can combo into other aerials. 

**F-Air:** Goomba headbutts to the side, covering from up-forward to down-forward in an arc. This attack spikes, meaning Alpharad is allowed to play this character. 

**B-Air:** Goomba kicks behind itself, turning around in the process. A decent kill move at very high percents, it is otherwise useless. 

**Up Air:** Goomba strikes upward with its Paragoomba wings, utilizing a disjointed hitbox. This move also sends Goomba downward slightly.

**D-Air:** Goomba kicks downward three times, each hit doing more damage. However, it won't spike, instead sending the enemy to the side. 

#Special Moves:

**Neutral Special: Megagoomba** This is Goomba's main gimmick move. It slowly enlarges itself to twice its default size. Like Deep Breathing, an interruption in this process makes Goomba have to start over. However, when Goomba's size is doubled, all of his hitboxes and damage get a x2 multiplier as well. This turns Goomba into a much more powerful heavyweight.

**Side Special: Goomba Charge** Goomba rockets forward, knocking aside anyone in the way. This move is basically Rollout but without a long startup or direction changing.

**Up Special: Paragoomba** Goomba sprouts wings and flies into the air, dealing no damage. For a recovery move, it has very little vertical distance, but there is wide horizontal drift to compensate.

**Down Special: Microgoomba** Goomba releases up to three microgoombas, which run across the stage and latch on to enemies, like Pikmin. However, if Goomba is still supersized, it places regular Goombas instead, which function more like Mechakoopas, hitting opponents but not attaching. 

**Final Smash: Gigagoomba** Goomba grows to the size of the screen and charges across it, similarly to Ganondorf's final smash. 

Take that, u/baabbo.",SmashBrosUltimate

"I formed really bad habits and I’m fully aware of them when they are executed, but I can’t find a way to stop","I have been playing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate on and off since launch, but spent the last 3 - 4 weeks playing super consistently. My GSP with Peach and Wii Fit Trainer is above 4m right now, and I’m working on Isabelle and Inkling at the same time. I would like to get better, but I am having so much trouble with certain things. I made a few notes on my biggest issues:

- My movement is really bad, resulting in me missing attacks / grabbing a lot of the time. I probably successfully pull off 3 / 10 grabs on a per-game basis

- On the inverse, it seems like people I face all have incredibly good movement skill and very rarely have trouble attacking me / getting stocks off of me

- Even with Tilt Attacks set to the right analog stick, I can’t seem to consistently execute them. Sometimes it feels like they don’t come out at all, but whenever I am in Training they always do- so I know it’s a me issue and not a controller issue

- I SD a lot trying to punish off stage

- I struggle the most with projectile characters like Richter

Kirby Main. Need help getting into elite smash,"Hey guys I've been a Kirby Main since the N64 days so I've seen how he's changed over the years. It's sad to see him in bottom tier, but I still continue to play online with kirbs all the time. Actually, I've been trying all summer to try to get into elite smash - albeit with no luck...

one reason I stick with the guy is because I've gotten so comfortable doing combos and edgeguarding with him.even though it causes a lot of online players to quit immediately, I love to use his suicide tricks (screw the haters). Honestly I have more fun playing Kirby than anyone else in the roster  because he's nonstop action and, like a bishop on a chessboard, he occupies the diagonal space better than anybody. I admit, Kirby's biggest flaw when you fight really good players is that you can never let your guard down ever; It's like playing in hard mode. His range is so terrible, and his attacks aren't that strong, but regardless of that I love playing him.

One thing I've been struggling with a lot in ultimate is that everyone can now directional Dodge out of combos. I also use my sword an unhealthy amount because it actually has higher reach than the kicks. I swear a DK running full harge at you is probably the most terrifying thing in the game.

Nintendo Battle Pad With input Lag??,"Hey smash community!!
So, these days i was feeling a LOT of input lag with the switch joycons ( something like 1 second to get every single command to work, and sometimes i wasn’t even jumping when clicking the buttons ) and that made me wanna buy the nintendo battle pad because of the gamecube controller style, and the direct usb connection.
But even after buying it, i am feeling a little bit of input lag. I realized it when my first pick was fox, and i just couldn’t spam the pistol special attack. After 2-4 shots it stops and after a while it continues. 
After that, i realized that this lag was everywhere. 
Those milliseconds are precious and important when battling, and i’ve spent like 40 dollars on the controller...

"A potential new theory for the 5th DLC character? A discussion about the ""Regional Appeal"" theory","Nothing here is an attempt to confirm anything or anything like that, just a pattern that some people have been noticing. The idea came to my head when I saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/Jiikae/status/1168694293604622336) on my twitter feed, and it basically hints at a sort of ""Regional Appeal"" theory. Ofc it's just a pattern, nothing that confirms anything, but I thought it could bring up some discussion.

The main idea behind this theory is that the Fighters Pass is attempting to appeal to the worldwide audience, covering pretty much every region in the world. Hence the name ""Regional Appeal"" theory. Correct me if I'm wrong but this is the pattern I've been noticing.

Joker is a bit of a wild card here, but he is most popular in North America and Japan iirc

Hero appeals mostly to the Eastern audience, mainly Japan

Banjo and Kazooie appeal mostly to the Western audience, mainly North America

Terry (if he does in fact turn out to be DLC Pack 4) would appeal to Latin America and I think China as well

So that leaves Europe and Australia/New Zealand, which can be grouped together since I'm pretty sure they're similar when it comes to game popularity.

I wanted to start a discussion on who the last DLC fighter could be if this theory turned out to be legit (which it probably isn't but still, speculating is fun). I'll go first.

So I know for a fact that Crash Bandicoot is very very popular in these regions, especially the UK and Australia. He is pretty popular in the rest of Europe and New Zealand as well. Doom I'm pretty sure is popular in the UK and Australia, but not so much in the rest of Europe (correct me if I'm wrong here). In fact I'm pretty sure Doom was banned in Germany until 2011 or something like that so I'm not sure how well Doom Guy fits into this theory. Ryu Hayabasa (who was recently revealed to be DLC for another game, announced by PlayStation in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1168896128982704133), just as something to note) I'm also not too sure about. I think Ninja Gaiden is mainly popular in North America and Japan but not so much everywhere else? I can't back that up though so I could be wrong. When all is said and done, I'd say Crash best fits into the final slot based on this theory. What do you guys think?",SmashBrosUltimate

How to beat an aerial-spamming Corrin?,"I’ve recently been playing Smash with some new friends who are good sports and respectable people, but one of them loves cheesing moves. My big problem is that one of them mains Corrin and spams aerial combos. It’s really hard to escape them, because I only recently got familiar with aerial dodges and shield timing.

I do favor smash attacks over specials because I’m not a hypocrite when I say that using too many specials is bad, therefore I mainly use smash and dash attacks. However, they also love spamming Corrin’s counter, then locking me into another aerial combo, then using Corrin’s up-special to eliminate me. If I survive, they use that lunge attack that pins me on the ground, which isn’t always hard to dodge. I’m currently maining Piranha Plant btw, but I’m decent with Ridley, Mewtwo, and Greninja.

8: stage spike into up something as a kill move (I play Ness it really has gotten a bit dull)

9: “it’s Sakurais game he can do whatever he wants”

10: the fact that nobody in Nintendo is talking about how pit and dark pit need some buffs

11: ryu and ken spamming down b to get on the ledge or land safely

12: MARIO is the mascot of Nintendo... you don’t have to shove it in our face.

13: the whole “super strong but shitty recovery” gimmick is bland now

14: young link is weaker than ness... I just want to let that set in for those who played both games.

15: the online is bland... like once you’ve reached elite smash that’s it.

17: i don’t play final fantasy 7 (yet I have it just I haven’t played it yet) but I’m pretty sure there are more than 2 sound tracks 

18: if you’re playing a character to have the nostalgia of the game... most of the time you’ll fail. It’ll introduce you to new games definitely but if you played the game then played the character... you’ll know what I mean. Felt this with Ness.

Why do so many people play like moving towards an enemy/initiating is unreasonable?,"Title says it all. Been playing for about three days and I'm beginning to get frustrated with just how many people play in a way that to me is just \*not\* Smash. It's really, really boring and I find myself just throwing the games because I'll try to throw in something flashy for fun (playing Cpt. Falcon) and then obviously I'll just get absolutely buttered - which I wouldn't mind if it weren't for the fact 90% of my opponents will stand still, and wait for me to attack them for over a minute before they go \*huh, aw jeez, guess I should do something right\*. Highlights of this have been an Ike standing in the middle of the map spamming short-hop fair nonstop even when I stopped moving for 45s+, a Peach who literally allowed me to afk for over two minutes because she refused to ever walk towards me along some others. Is this normal? I'd honestly like to know because if so, it's clear I've made a mistake in buying this piece of hot garbage.

"I absolutely hate Joker's counter, but I also find that it, personally, for me, adds a level of depth and mechanic to the game","So, one of my friends mains Joker, and, being that I'm a severely aggressive player, his counters are a little... annoying, to say the least. Joker's counters are simultaneously activate-able, lasts a stupidly long time, and has a super large hit box. I used to complain about it so much and just hated it. But, as of late, it's added a level of depth to the game that I had yet to discover: baiting.

Now, I'm no pro by any means. I don't have a locals around me, nor have I ever gone through the effort of entering a tournament, major or minor. I just play with friends for fun. But, of course, I try to be as mechanically sound as possible. I'm a beginner, and Smash Ultimate is basically my first Smash title, so learning all of the mechanics was really fun for me. Spot dodging, frames, juggling opponents, learning how to add grabs into a combo, fighting off the stage, edge guarding... all of these mechanics took a lot of time and effort to learn, but their concepts were very straightforward, which is why I never even considered baiting.

In my opinion, baiting is the most difficult mechanic of all. After all, you can NEVER say with 100% certainty what an opponent will do, and thus, you can never know when an opponent will fall for your bait, or if they will counter-bait you. There's just so much set-up involved, and you have to rely on your senses for a good chunk of it to be successful. It's been quite the journey learning how to bait opponents, but I don't think that there's a character who serves the role of being the best bait-practice out of them all than Joker. I can't bait my friend's shield 100% of the time, but when I do achieve that, and take a stock as a result, it feels so satisfying, haha

I hate Joker, but I also love him for making me a better player.",SmashBrosUltimate

That being said, if he were ever added, I would not hate on him, I'd just get on with my day and would be happy for those who wanted him.

Nintendo has already added every character I can ever reasonably expect and want so I'm happy, any other new character is a plus for me.",SmashBrosUltimate
Isaac for Smash. Here’s why," I actually think Isaac from The Binding of Isaac franchise would be a really good character in my opinion. He’s from an incredibly well-known indie game, and is actually in a fighting game on Steam called Blade Strangers. 

Isaac has literally hundreds of items to use, as well as synergies with said items, it’s been on the Switch for years now, Repentance DLC is coming in December, and he has great alt potential with other characters like Maggie Cain Judas and ???, as well as various costumes from the items. It also has an amazing OST, and many locations for maps(Isaac’s room, various levels and floors in the game, maybe even the Void, or something from Repentance). 

And the crude, gory and disgusting nature of Isaac isn’t a problem, since Bayo, arguably the most oversexualized character in any game that isn’t just straight up porn somehow got in, in spite of being toned down a lot. I feel if we took away the blood in some of Isaac’s moves and interactions, we could have a very solid concept for a character. 

For an entrance, Isaac could be curled up in fetal position, like how he does at the start of every floor, and gets up.

For his taunts, here’s some ideas:

Up Taunt: Isaac could hold a random passive item above his head, as if picking it up. 

Side Taunt: Isaac smiles and gives a thumbs up as the jingle from a positive pill effect is effect is heard. A second after, the announcer from Isaac says “Luck Up!”. In spite of this, the taunt has no effect on gameplay.

Down Taunt: Guppy appears on screen, and Isaac picks him up and hugs him. Guppy jumps out of Isaac’s arms, and becomes a projectile, similar to Snake’s box. I could imagine some funny Guppy gimps happening lmao.

Isaac’s victory screens here would be:

-Isaac standing on front of his toy chest, facing away from the camera. He would look back at it before jumping into it.

-Isaac jumping into a trap door on the floor, and leaving the screen.

-The light beam after beating Hush/Mom’s Heart/It Lives appears, and 

Here are some move ideas, although I won’t give most move names because idk which one. I just hope it’s nothing like Hero’s Down B and they just get some of the more well known or interesting attacks in:

Neutral B- Tears: Isaac fires tears in front of him, dealing 3.5% damage each. If held down, Isaac can walk and jump, similar to Mega Man. Although to differentiate from him, this is all in one move, and Isaac can have a proper F tilt and Nair(no offense)

Ipecac: Isaac lobs an Ipecac tear that can change angles depending on directional inputs, similar to Simon/Richter’s axes.

Down B- Telekinesis: Isaac holds the item above his head, and all projectiles that touch him stay close and become his. If a projectile of his touches someone or something, it would interact with the object as it would in any other situation. A few seconds later, all projectiles are launched, similar to how the item behaves in Isaac

Up B- How to Jump: Isaac jumps in the direction the stick is facing, similar to Pikachu’s Up B, except Isaac has heavy armor, no hit box, and can act after the move is used

Final Smash- Mega Laser: Isaac fires a Mega Laser and is pushed back slowly. Isaac can move the laser slightly. After the move is used, Isaac gains a Brimstone costume for the rest of the stock.

Pill: Isaac holds up a pill, and gets a very minor, random effect. He gets 2 pills every stock and it takes awhile before he can use the other. The effect would be noticeable, but no game breaking, almost like Judge. 
Speed Up: Isaac moves slightly faster
Speed Down: the opposite
Range Up: all tear attacks go slightly farther
Range Down: the opposite again",SmashBrosUltimate
Newbie looking to be competitive. Who should I work on? And general help.,"So I’m a true newb to smash, but I’m a competitive person with serous smash friends. Im trying to figure out 1-2 characters I should focus on.

I find it interesting how the dlc for smash 4 and ultimate has been completely the opposite of each other.,"I was just thinking about the rumored next dlc character and how many people did not know who they are, and I have seen this as a trend for the dlc characters this time around. For the average smash fan in North America the picks of Joker, Hero and (rumored 4th character) have been characters that they never heard of, while banjo is only known to some due to the demand that is shown on reddit and twitter and if they didn't see the demand on these sites may not know who he is either.

Being as a smash fan in my 20's I have heard of the characters, but kids younger than me might have not been exposed to when Banjo, Dragon Quest and (4th character franchise) were more mainstream names.

This is the opposite of smash 4 where we knew all the 3 returning fighters due to them being in past games, and Ryu, Cloud, and Bayonetta due to being famous video game characters. (Corrin being the exception due to being a promotion pick to sell fire emblem fates)

While I honestly don't mind either route they take it's just interesting seeing the development of the fighters picked between both smash games.",SmashBrosUltimate

"Here's my 2 cents on Hero, take it wirh a grain of salt","He is broken. Utterly and completely broken. I'm not saying OP. but broken. He literally breaks every kind of consistency and 'rules we've had regarding characters in Smash Ultimate. His strength? Rng. 
His weakness? Rng. 
Weirdly, that does NOT make him inconsistent!

Hero is in a terrible spot if you ask me. I mean, he makes the game feel pretty bad if you ask me. I'm not saying that as a salty player who kept losing to Heroes all week. My winratio must be around 50% and mostly because I thought it would be smart to pick sheik, probably my worst character, to climb GSP today. His sword range, for a swordie is kinda ridoculous in the sense that he has slow, but very safe optons in forward air and neutral air, a pretty safe landing option with down air and up B (let's ignore zoom for now). All these options will result in either a positive option or at the very least a good trade for him. 

His down B while being RNG has so many more good options that it doesn't even require you to be able to read. You just dpam and you're bound to get something good. The only thing you should look for is if there's kamikaze. Literally.  For instance:
I played a guy who would keep spamming down B at every chance he gor. This is what happened:

Oomph, psych up, into snooze into a crit smash.

I spawn, put pressure by 'dominating' only to inflict around 25% while he spams down b to manage to get a hatchet man (without reading) on my shield, break shield into fully charged smash into thwack death. 


I lost a match where he got only purely lucky. I barely lost, but still lost. I played even more careful and won (barely next match) only bexause he didn't get the very best rng outcome but if it weren't for his rng, I would have completely dominated that player. Rng allowed him to compete on a lvl he really shouldn't be able to. 

On my main (Joker, around 4.5mil), I get so many Heroes and so many of them are terrible but I barely manage to win due to those random down Bs that end up changing the whole game. Almost every time for their advantage. Rng is supposed to be neutral. By that I mean, it shouldn't heavily favour you, but it could potentially help you in a lost scenario or make you lose a scenario where you were at an advantage. But with hero its more like: am I going to get a big advantage or am I going to get a gamechanging advantage? 

His worst options are only 2: kamikaze, and a negative hocus pocus(hp). Hp has such a rare spawnrate, it's not even worrh mentioning. Kamikaze is pretty rare as well and those 'accidental' SDs happened only twice in those 50+matches I had against hero. 

add to this his specials that are not only pretty fast, but can all kill at very early percentages, have armor to a certain degree, and get usually little punish unless you spam it blondly all the time, and the fact that he has a very good recovery as well as decent weight. 

I really dislike this character's essence of being. He is the first time I've had a character that I like to play but absolutely despise to play against. 

You've got your memes like Ganon or Ness pm this forum, but these characterd have onöy certaon annoying moved and you know how to counterplay it. With hero it's like: well maybe he'll randomly hit me with 20 potentially different moves and I have to engage him by keeping an eye out for all of these, or I just rush in and hope it's gonna go well. 

It's horrible. It destroys the gap between skill and mashers to me. That probably isn't the case in high skill play and probably won't be the case in tournaments. I'm talking as your average joe player here though... and it's really drustrating to deal with a character that can literally just kill any character on the roster at 0% through a more likely than not fortunate seriws of random down Bs.",SmashBrosUltimate
Anybody else getting sick of ultimate?,"Idk man this game just hasn't been able to keep me invested in it over the long term. I got my mains  ganondorf, wolf, Wii fit, donkey Kong, and now hero into elite smash and now I don't really feel like there's anything to keep me going anymore. Joker was fun and a great addition while hero is a pretty stupid character to add to a competitive fighting game (although he is SO fun in a casual setting) and it really feels like they spit on the competitive scene with him. 

The lack of fun single player content (I personally think spirit and classic modes are too repetitive) and horrendous online they refuse to change at all seals the deal for me. The new tourneys are fun but after playing through and winning a few of them people resort to degenerate tactics as much as possible and it's literally a chore to fight those people. 

I wanna love this game like I did at launch but since change isn't gonna come I might just go over to pm or melee netplay from now on.",SmashBrosUltimate

Hero has insane buffs!,"So I was playing around with Hero in cunstom smash with my friend and we tried to see how much damage he could do in one move.

What we were trying to do was use all of Hero’d buffs and gimmicks to get max damage. We were both big and heavy thanks to custom smash, and we stacked psyche up and oomph as well as became big from Hocus Pocus as well as got 150% damage to max out rage, then I did a fully charged f smash and got a critical hit.

The final result was about 340% worth of damage (keep in mind this was done without spirits or items). This is absolutely crazy because not only is this more damage than any other character can pull off at once, but the amount of buffs Hero has as well as how powerful they are really shows how stupid this character is. Sakurai, PLEASE fix this!!",SmashBrosUltimate
A Quick Guide to Countering/Beating Hero.,"I know as of recent, Hero's been getting a bit of infamy for how polarizing of a character he is and his ability to just do a lot of damage and kill people really early. It might be bad design, some say he's unfair but that's not what I'm here to discuss. 

I'm going to give my thoughts and experience currently fighting against and playing as the character.

Hero's strong no doubt. His greatest strengths lie in his Specials. Neutral and Side Special have different charge states which are versatile and do a lot of damage. Up Special is good too, a great OOS option and can be used to frame-trap offstage opponents. Down-B is full of shenanigans and possibly the best Special when used correctly. 

Hero's weaknesses though also lie in his specials. Hero is over-reliant on them to do damage and to bolster his Normals. His normals are quite honestly a bit below average in comparison to other Swordfighters. A big issue is that many of them are slow and don't combo well. His meh normals are also what ties into his other weakness, the MP system. The fastest way to recover MP is to land said normals. The only normals to look out for are his smashes because of his passive Critical Hit ability. Bad players will typically throw them out a lot, especially when they've gotten a Down-B Buff in Oomph or Psyche-Up. If predictable, they can be avoided, shielded or even parried. Shielding is not advised though D:

The best state to get Hero in is to bait out his specials and suck his MP dry. When you've done that, you can apply constant pressure to keep Hero in a disadvantage state. Hero has a bad disadvantage and is pretty easy to outpace. His recovery is a bit linear and can be gimped. He has poor offstage options and I'm not counting Zoom here because it's all in RNG. Sure it might happen once every 3 games but that's something you can't really control and it sucks, I know.

Is Hero fun to fight against? No. Is he Overpowered? I don't know. Does he have exploitable weaknesses? Yes, he does.

I hope this helps some frustrated Smashers out there, I'm sorry if this doesn't help you. 

What is a way you've been able to counter Hero pretty well? Let me know in the comments!",SmashBrosUltimate

Suggested Buffs for the Hero,"So I heard that the community is considering banning Hero. I didn't read the petition, but if a character is being banned, it's clearly because it sucks so much that no one would bother using it anyway. I also heard a lot of people complaining that there wasn't enough RNG in his moveset, so I made sure that much buffs included plenty of randomness to keep the game fresh. Without further ado, buffs that could make Hero viable. I had more this morning but I didn't write them down and forgot them. I will edit this post if I remember them.

Add Zing to his list of Down B spells. For anyone who hasn't played a Dragon Quest game, Zing has a 50% chance to resurrect a fallen ally. This spell would be like the Special Flag item (In time matches it gives a point, in stock matches, it gives a stock), but with faster use time, and only work half the time. If I recall correctly, it costs 6 MP in Dragon Quest 11, so in SSBU, it will cost 6 MP as well.

Hero should become randomly pepped up during the match, increasing all of his stats. This would be indicated by the same animation that plays in Dragon Quest 11. While pepped up, using Down B will give spells in the second, third and fourth options, and a pep power in the first option, which costs 0 MP, but un-peps the Hero and reverses the stat changes. If not ended prematurely with a pep power, pep ups can last 20-30 seconds, and happen maybe once or twice a game, if it's an average three stock match. Pep Powers should be roughly equal in power to an FS Meter final smash.

Some examples of pep powers can be: 

* Tempered Tantrum - a better version of Flame Slash. Landing it would be similar to landing a Fire Emblem Character's Critical Hit final smash.
* The Fight Fantastic - a much better version of Oomph
* 0 Zone - Reduces the cost of spells to 0 MP for a limited time
* Solar Flair - See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxY4WOAw3CE). It would cover just about the whole stage.
* [Kazapstrophe](https://youtu.be/QZ2fjfjTSKk?t=365) \- Think Kazap but basically a final smash, like Solar Flair.
* Yggdragon's Blessing - This one would give you the invincibility star effect for an extended period of time.

Well, hopefully these buffs can give the character the love it deserves. I personally thought that the character was balanced without the buffs, but if you have any ideas for more buffs that you think the Hero needs, be sure to let me know!",SmashBrosUltimate

Hero isn’t that hard to beat,"Maybe he was on day one, but his entire moveset revolves around a very exploitable flaw: waiting.  

 He is at his strongest at the start of the match, with both distance and a full bar of MP. You simply have to rush him down before he can charge up his neutral special, and once you have him, the match is yours. He can’t charge any specials if you’re in his face, and he can’t up special forever.  

Keep in mind this is coming from not a Hero main, but a Ken main. In my honest opinion hero is getting way too much hate, just like joker did, and to an extent, piranha plant. It’s just bound to happen that when a new character enters the game, counters take a while to be found. I found mine, and I find it hard to believe that neither has anyone else. Sakurai and everyone who worked on ultimate specifically made every character so balanced that there are no clear broken characters.

Thoughts on dlc do far/Who do you think will be the last 2 dlc fighters?,"So far, the dlc for ultimate is pretty good. 

Challenger Pack 1: Joker and Mementos
I really like how Joker was revealed, even with no knowledge of the character. I also like how he plays, Joker is good. Mementos is a good stage, but I don't play it that often. Also, Persona music is amazing.

Challenger Pack 2: Hero and Yggdrasil's Altar
I think everyone saw this character coming, with the leaks and all. Despite the character being all but confirmed, the trailer was still a little surprising (if you didn't follow leaks, people thought we would only get the DQ3 hero, not 4 heroes.) As for how Hero plays, he is fun, but definitely needs nerfs. Yggdrasil's Altar is a nice stage. Dragon Quest's music is good.

Challenger Pack 3: Banjo &amp; Kazooie and Spiral Mountain
This character was the highlight of E3 for me, as Banjo-Kazooie is my second favorite game of all time (Xenoblade Chronicles 1 is the only game better imo.) Their trailer was amazing. Spiral Mountain looks like a cool stage. The Spiral Mountain remix is also amazing. I can't wait for this character to come out.

Now onto my predictions for Challenger Pack 4 and Challenger Pack 5.

Challenger Pack 4: Phoenix and The Courtroom
The first character I am predicting is Phoenix Wright from Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. His trailer would probably play out like a regular court case, except he would get new evidence, a mysterious letter. He would open the letter and it would say Phoenix: Takes The Case. His stage would be the courtroom. 

Challenger Pack 5: Crash and Neo Cortex's Lair
The other character I am predicting is Crash Bandicoot from Crash Bandicoot. His trailer would have to include characters like Mario, Sonic, and Banjo (90's icons). They would be fighting and suddenly you see a orange blur. It would stop, show Crash and say Crash: Goes For A Spin. Crash's stage would be Neo Cortex's Lair.

"Why ""The Hero's"" Inclusion in Smash Bros. was a Dream of Mine Since MELEE","I vividly remember back in 2005, going up to an EB games and seeing an advert for the new Dragon Quest VII game coming soon to the PS2 and my father commenting that he thought the new installment looked great. What he didn't know, is that I had it pre-ordered for his birthday coming around the corner.

My father doesn't play many games, and actually he is quite picky with the titles he plays, but I can say for certain, he is a fan of the DQ series starting all the way back with Dragon Warrior. Growing up I tended to only play on my Nintendo consoles and when I was lucky, I was able to play on my Dad's PS2 and 3 when he wasn't home. I remember watching him beat DQ VIII and the music left an impact on my life forever after. 

See, my Father was at an age he couldn't play DQ9 because of the smaller screen hurting his eyes (you should of seen his excitement when DQXI was announced for PS4!) and he would complain about how he hasnt played a game as good as DQVIII ever since beating it and he wished that there would be more Dragon Quest here in the west. Well,  there were only a few games I played a lot myself as well, and one of them at the time was Super Smash Bros. Melee. I remember watching Melee invite Marth and Roy into the fray, even though absolutely no one over here in the west knew who they were, and single-handedly brought Fire Emblem to the west (and with their new installments in Brawl and Sm4sh making the Fire Emblem games a house hold title here in the west). 

Over the years growing up I always recommended DQVIII to my friends I met along the way, adn to my surprise, nobody have ever played the series or even knew what it was at the least. The friends who played DQVIII, after I recommended it to them, ended up falling in love with the title just as my Father and I did. The FACT that I knew these titles were amazing games and yet, the west was pretty much blindfolded to them, baffled me (and still does).

The only logical thing I could think of was...what if...and just what if... Dragon Quest got represented in Smash Bros. one day? I mean, Smash saved many series of video game titles and even brought obscure ones no one heard of to the front-line ( Ice Climbers, Game and Watch, etc.). ""What if Smash Bros could get this series in front of peoples' eyes?"" I thought to myself, ""I truly believe that Dragon Quest will speak for itself, just as long as people actually take action to give the series a chance."" 

I've been waiting years for this, and yes, I voted for a Slime and the DQVIII hero to be in smash all the way back in the Smash Ballot. 

P.S. Thank you to my Dad for showing me these games, and thank you Me for buying DQVIII when I was 8 years old.

"Haven’t seen any posts about this, so figured I’d throw this out here.","So, im sure few of you know, but this year is mobile suit gundam’s 40th anniversary. Gundam is a MASSIVELY influential series in japan, essentially being one of the first series to separate anime from just being a kids thing, as anime was viewed back in the 70s. It is also incredibly recognizable to most people, even if youre not really familliar with specifics. 

To be honest, i think theres a tiny yet interesting chance thst gundam could be a fighter. I wanna list some reasons, just for conversation!

1. The anniversary. The simple fact that such a long running series is at a big ten year milestone boosts chances, and increases interest in the topic.

2. Recognizability. Anybody in Japan knows gundam. Seriously, EVERYBODY IN JAPAN KNOWS AT LEAST 1 GUNDAM. They’ve at least heard of it. This makes it a larger contender as well.

3. Bandai rep. Bandai is a very likely rep due to the fact that bandai namco codevelops smash ult. Well, bandai spirits just so happens to make essentially all merch for all of gundam, and bandai namco makes almost all gundam games. These 2 companies, of course, are both owned by bandai.

Yoshi Buffs,"I’ve been playing Yoshi for a few months, and I think he needs a few small tweaks. I’m not just somebody saying “my main needs to be better because I’m not good enough”, I just think that Yoshi actually needs these buffs to compare against some other fighters. There are two buffs I think would do him the most justice 
Speed up his roll- His roll is slow as hell, and can be punished by anybody smart enough to do it. Speeding up his roll will help him avoid getting punished for something that is meant to dodge an attack. 
Faster grab- his grab is also very slow. A lot of options that aren’t normally safe on shield are safe on him because you can easily avoid his grab. Even if his throws are garbage and throw combos don’t really get you anywhere, a faster grab will make moves unsafe on his shield again and would help him against almost every character.

What characters would be used as Persona 4 spirits?,"We got the Persona 5 party members as dlc spirits which was awesome, but I think it'd be cool to see what characters they would use for spirits from Persona 4. 

I've thought up of a few already. I tried to avoid using characters that were used for the Persona 5 spirits:

Yu = Robin (male, base color)
Yosuke = Pit (black color)
Chie = Wii Fit Trainer (female, green color) 
Yukiko = Zelda (red color)
Kanji = Incineroar (black color)
Rise = Peach (black color)
Teddie = Bowser Jr. (Ludwig)
Naoto = Bayonetta (base color)

You could definitely argue different characters, these were just what I thought. 

There are some others I didn't place like each of their Personas, Adachi, the Velvet Room attendants, and the non combatant social links like Nanako and Dojima.",SmashBrosUltimate
SSB.:U UNDERTALE PROTAGONIST PRSNL. OPINION,"
NO JOB INTERFERENCES WITH NINTENDO 
NO JOB INTERFERENCES WITH SORA LTD

I apologize if the title of this text post is very misleading, but this inserts my personal opinions about the possibility of the UNDERTALE protagonist (Self-Explanitory) of entering as a downloadable content challenger in the present-time modern title inside the Super Smash Brothers sequence, :Ultimate if America, :Special if Asia Regions. 

Newcomers exclusive to :Ultimate and :Special were presented from frequently broadcasted Nintendo Directs, The Electronic Entertainment Expo and The Game Awards 2018, then becoming interactive on December 7th, newcomers invited by Director, Producer Masahiro Sakurai, not Nintendo, constructed from the ballot that launched on 2015, April 1st. 

Director/Producer Masahiro Sakurai later mentioned in the future that downloadable content challengers were not to be chosen specifically by Nintendo, if the challenger entry follows terms, guidelines, and rules, the company or organization responsible or the challenger will then be contacted early and will asked for assistance. A Non Disclosure Agreement is also involved, where two parties agree not to reveal of what both parties were involved in for a period of time. 

Once two parties have agreed to both the Non Disclosure Agreement and selected permissions, Nintendo will lend a file to Sora Ltd with instructed material to guide on. In order to follow the Non Disclosure Agreement, companies or organizations may restrict platforms of social media or continue focusing with other extreme projects.  

Toby Fox uses the Twitter social media platform. His tweet from 7/13/18: 

@tobyfox
Have you ever thought about how tall Candy Kong is?

Donkey Kong's whole thing is that he's a giant ape, right? But Candy Kong stands at twice his height...

If she was a fighter in Smash Brothers, she'd be even bigger than Ridley...
(Original Tweet Includes Image)

Toby Fox then replied underneath in (Tweet your Reply):

I try to use this Twitter for only really important things, but this information qualified somehow...

——————————————————————————
With the Non Disclosure Agreement, the parties are free to talk about different topics or subjects, long as it doesn’t spell out or leak their involvements. Social media users following Toby Fox on Twitter platforms didn’t mind and took it rather a joke, although the way I see it, the wording can be read in both a casual or a serious matter, unsure if this leads to a mistake or rather fooling around.

When a specific movement set is created for a challenger, the movements typically represent the game(s) the challenger was involved in. Ex: Dr. Mario.

The chosen challenger also has to strongly represent both their party and the game(s) the challenger was involved in.

When it comes to challengers, such as Ness or Lucas, who originated alongside the Super Nintendo’s graphical art style, changes need to be made in order to get a right model that both suits the origin and the player’s mind. With UNDERTALE’s protagonist and it’s art style, major aggressive changes will have to be made. The slight eyes of the protagonist will need to be changed, as well of all the other body parts. With a challenger like Frisk, assistance may become very violent between both parties. 

Leakers have speculated that the protagonist will be involved with :Ultimate and :Special Fighter’s Pass as an income challenger, however I believe it will take up time.

Players of UNDERTALE differ from having different images of the protagonist, and gender identity is yet.
Even one mistake of the render model can stab a pain into both the Super Smash Brothers. sequence and experiences with both UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE.

"""Overwriting"" enemy attacks?","When I play against certain people they basically ""overwrite"" my basic attacks with theirs. My attack that I executed earlier than theirs hits, but gets anulled by their later executed basic attack and I get hit. Now, I know some attacks have some kind of power armor or can ""tank"" one hit like Dededes up-tilt, but I am talking about, that against some people every possible normal attack of them ""overwrites"" my basic attack, basically 3-stocking me without recieving any damage.

It is independend from character, e.g. Ganondorf dair gets overwritten by some nair or tilt AFTER I clearly hit them. They can also perform basic attacks while grabbed by me.

I just played against a Yoshi with Dedede and the Yoshi just ignored every attack I landed on him and attacked through my basic attacks. Also he instantly shield right before getting hit, even thogh he attacked right before and should have a few frames downtime before using his shield, instead of instantly.

Then right after I played against a Wii Fit Trainer with Ganondorf. He overwrote every of my normal attacks with his.

Since it's not depended on a specific character this has to bei either a technique or a cheat program. So which is it and if it's a technique how does it work?

I'd really like to understand how they do it.",SmashBrosUltimate

Overwriting attacks?,"I often play against people who overwrite my normal attack with theirs. Doesn't matter which character. In these matches they basically 3-stock me without getting hit.

What I mean is: I attack and it visually hits just as they start using a normal attack. Their attack is cancelling out mine, basically overwriting it and I get hit. Every standard (A-Button) attack. The whole match.

Example: 

(1)Dedede (me) vs Yoshi, he overwrote every of my hits. Could only hurt him with neutral-B and side-B.

(2) Ganondorf (me) vs Wii Fit Trainer. Same story.

The list goes on, with me playing every possible character, like Zelda, Joker, Cloud etc.

And before someone mentions this, I know some attacks can ""tank"" one hit or have power-armor, but that's not what I mean.

So how do I do it, since many people seem to know how it works. Because I don't think it can be a cheat program (you can't even cheat on Switch, can you?)

Hot take that's bouta get me some heat,"Little Mac and Hero are not poorly designed but rather the opposite with a lot of work being put in to reflect each character's base game. To elaborate, while both characters present design problems to the competitive scene every decision made for the characters is clearly based in the game. It's alot less noticable with Little Mac so I'mma use him as the main example. Little Mac is a boxer and as such can't do anything in the air but hits like a Mac truck on the ground (see what I did there). He plays like a boxer cause he is one, bobbing and weaving with some of the best roles, smashes, and tilts. Everything down to how he stands was meticulously designed and animated to look like a boxer. My main point here is that neither character is in any way poorly designed, rather greatly designed with a crap town of work out on to them, but instead poorly designed for the competitive scene. Before I get written off as a ""filthy casual"" consider the fact that this game isn't designed for the competitive scene but still has one of the biggest competitive scenes, and that tenacity from the community is what is really fascinating to me. But we shouldn't write characters off that had a lot of work put in to them just because they weren't designed for the largest use. (As a sidenote: I do wish Nintendo would support the competitive scene a bit more though without changing their design choices with the game since it makes for a wacky fun experience to me)",SmashBrosUltimate

Should Short Hopping Simply Be A Face Button?,"First off this is my first post and i dont know if i was supposed to put a topic like this in this reddit or the r/smashbros reddit but the other seemed to only be filled with EVO stuff and i didnt want to seem out of place.

So to get into the topic, i think you should be able to set short hopping as X or Y and have the other be the normal jump. A lot of people may not like the idea of this because they see short hopping as a pro tech but it's honestly lost the pro part because anyone can do it, it's just hard to do it consitently. It can either be done by pressing jump incredibly fast that can be hard to do in the middle of a match or (what i've been doing since i main Joker) pressing two jump buttons at the same exact time however can be difficult especially for people who simply dont have big thumbs and for those that do (like me) it makes your thumb feel raw after extended use. 

The first is how the function worked in SSB4 but the second was added to SSBU and made the tech essentially easy access for casuals and people who have problems timing the press of jump. Alternatively you can press a jump and attack button at the same time to do a short hop attack instantly but it's really situational. The point of this is, there's 3 ways to do short hops and two of which are ""noob friendly"" shortcuts. 

I strongly believe that since the tech has lost it's status as something only pros can do, rather than having two buttons on the face of the controller do the exact sams jump, they should allow you to change the input (if you wish) to set X or Y or whatever button you want to use to jump, to short hop. Because short hopping in SSBU isn't hard, (mainly thanks to the X+Y shortcut) it's just needlessly inconvient.

 I'd like to hear thoughts on such an input being added but please don't only take away that i said short hopping can be easily done by casuals and focus on that, wheter you think it's a professional tech or not short hopping has gotten objectively easier to do and I as a complete beginner (i've played smash games before but i've always been the type to just use smash attacks and specials without thought until SSBU where i'm trying to become an actual great player to the point i've sunken 150hrs into the game and only about 30hrs was with friends) can short hop with minimal difficulty. I just think it should simply be a button rather than an easy shortcut",SmashBrosUltimate

Side-special is Phazon scatter, like Luma's starbits, and can be charged up for higher damage

Up-special is a teleport

Neutral special is a beam rather than a projectile, like Joker's gun

Maining Low Tier Characters?,"I've been a Piranha Plant main since he was released.

In the future, maybe in a year or so when I feel ready, I want to start entering tournaments and competing at a higher level. The question is, am I limiting myself by maining Piranha? He's viewed as one of the worst characters in the game with some viewing him as second only to Little Mac as the worst character.

So while I can surely main the Plant and have success online and against friends without much issue, should I try to develop other character I like and am good with (Link, Samus, Ike, PacMan), with the goal of maining 1 or 2 of them in competitive/tournament play in the future?

The difference between Command Select and other gimmicks,"I'm going to try my best to keep this explanation impartial, I have fully separate opinions on Hero in terms of competitive play, viability, fun, etc., I just find the endless comparisons between Hero's Command Select and the gimmicks of other characters unfounded and want to try and show why people feel differently about the two. I'll be using Game &amp; Watch's Judge as an example because it is clearly the most comparable ""gimmick move"" 

Judge on the surface seems extremely similar to Hero's Commands, they both have random effects that can either be immensely powerful or a negative. However where the two differ is that  Judge's animation, hitbox and initial properties are all the same, the only thing that is RNG determined is the effect on a successful hit. Each number may have wildly varying amounts of power, damage and knockback, but until the move hits it is a slow, short range hammer with a single hit that is active on frame 16. You can always use the same options to stop yourself from being hit with the only real difference being how much frame disadvantage G&amp;W gets when hitting shield.

Inversely Hero's Command Selection has moves with wildly different properties making it so that no option is consistent. A reflector may work against Kaboom or Thwack, but will fail against melee attacks like Kacrackle Slash or Hatchet Man. A shield can block most attacks, but will be instantly broken by Hatchet Man, ignored by Kamikazee and do nothing to stop buffs like Oomph or Acceleratle. Moves that could space around a small projectile like Sizz will be caught by the enormous hitbox of Flame Slash, projectiles may be an effective method,, until Bounce makes them useless. The list can go on.

The difference between Hero getting a kill at 40 with Thwack and Wario getting one with Waft is that Waft is an ever present option, once enough time has passed the Wario player can use waft whenever they want and the enemy knows to expect it as a potential threat. A Hero player is stuck, unsure if they'll have access to the option they need and the opponent can't react accordingly when every option they can take has at least one counter.

I understand why people enjoy Hero, I understand why dislike him, but all that discussion aside people need to be aware that Hero truly is unlike anything ever seen in Smash. No other move is as versatile as Command Select, and despite that the move can be extremely restrictive, to compare it to anything else is unfair.",SmashBrosUltimate

A predicted Hero alteration: increased down B costs.,"I’ve been playing nothing but Hero since he came out. I’m enjoying the heck out of it.

But I’ve also been winning A LOT more than I used to as my best character. I’m returning to the franchise for the first time since being a teenager. I feel like I’m winning too much, honestly.

If there is to be a Hero nerf, I predict they will increase the cost of the down B spells. It’ll force Hero players to get into the fray melee style more often. The slow melee is one of his main downsides which balances out the incredible range spell assortment. As is, we pretty much have access to spells any time we need. It’s lethal once someone is thrown into a recovery situation.

I figure we are meant to be more a balance of melee and spells. If we can spam spells somewhat successfully that’ll be altered. Increasing cost or losing mana recovery might be the route they take.",SmashBrosUltimate

Hello,[removed],SmashBrosUltimate
#SUPPORT BOCCHI,In light of recent events everyone has taken the opportunity to complain how toxic the smash community but rather than focus on the hate let us express our support for Bocchi. Her win against Ally was completely deserved and she would be an incredible addition to the pro smash community. Please rather than attack those who did wrong let us pour all our love and support towards Bocchi and show her that she is really something special.,SmashBrosUltimate
Anyone wanna smash? My friend code is SW-7224-7828-8884,,SmashBrosUltimate
The Next Generation Of Smash Players,"The Boochi incident got me thinking 2 things

1.This community is toxic as hell

2.What will the next generation of Smash Players be like

By that I mean, who will be the next Smash Players that are young now but when they’re older they’ll be the best of the best

Rn I have 2 contenders:
Me, and Boochi

I’m 11 and I’m already playing competitively and matching against some High Tier Players 

As for Boochi well...
She fuckin beat Ally Why do I even need to explain anything

But is there anyone you know that’s young but an also amazing Smash Player, or are you really young but an amazing Smash Player and you think you are gonna be in the next generation of the best Smash Players, what do you think?",SmashBrosUltimate
Why not include Majora’s Mask young Link?,"In my mind, Link from Majora’s Mask would be an opportunity for another shape shifter type character like Pokémon trainer. You’d actually cycle through different masks. Goron would be a heavy brawler, Deku would be a light ranger and Zora would be an agile comboer like Zero Suit. Might even be a chance to include the legit Great Deity Link as a build up bar activation like Joker’s mechanic. All this and you’d just be giving up bombs on down B.

Why not? Surely I’m not the first to think of this. Why have we not seen it?",SmashBrosUltimate
What even is happening?, Will someone please explain what's been happening here? I seem to have missed something...,SmashBrosUltimate
What's going on?,"Could I please get a *detailed* explanation of the following:  


What transpired in the match between Ally and Bocchi - specifically, why are some people claiming her win was illegitimate?  


I read Ally's statement on Twitter, aside from the ex-gf stuff, there's content suggesting Ally had a relationship with a person called Zack who is apparently under the age of 18? How old is he exactly? According to twitter comments the relationship would've been legal in either parties home state / country. So apparently people now brand Ally as a pedophile, is all this accurate?  


So with Bocchi, could I please see some direct evidence of the ""bullying \[a 15 year old girl\] her off the game""? Screenshots of messages and comments would be best, if not just some non-verbatim repetition of what's been said / done?  


Here's my thought process: IF a tidal wave of hostility can force this young girl away from the scene then perhaps a tsunami of positivity and encouragement could bring her back?  


There's nothing up on YouTube yet and I've just seen all these ""Bullying a 15 year old girl"" memes, a bunch of ""Ally is a pedo"" memes and the classic ""Smash players don't shower"" memes.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - What happened - specifically, with screenshots / posts / links / messages. Also how old was the person Ally dated (""Zack"")?",SmashBrosUltimate
Everyone hating on the community as much as this sub is right now makes me think.,"I think the people who harassed the talented 15yo were just a loud minority. a very loud, very tiny minority. The way the community got together and supported her and bashed everyone who was negative and resentful makes me think it was just a few salty Ally fans.

What I mean to say us maybe this community isn't nearly as bad as we make it out to be lately. Maybe this is a huge community and there are bound to be a couple nutbags.

I still enjoy the memes about not showering though, keep em coming.",SmashBrosUltimate
How much data does a replay take up? I can't save any more,"The other night I was playing Quickplay and when I tried to save a replay of the match, it gave me an error saying I can't hold any more. 

Idk if there is a way to have replay data stored on the sd card by default, but even so, my system storage has 1.9 GB's left, and my sd card has well over 50GB's left. So I don't see how I could have gotten that error to begin with. 


Whats the average amount of space a smash replay takes up? And how come I got this error? And is there a way to have replays stored on the sd card (I know they go on the sd card when converted to video, but still. Can't convert to video without a replay)",SmashBrosUltimate
Is the only way to get better to keep playing?,I don’t really have anyone to do friendlies with. I can’t seem to get my gsp up mostly cause I’ll be doing good online then misinputs or forgetting I only have one jump kick in. I’ve been trying to main Young Link(so far has been really fun) I just make a bunch of dumb mistakes. Will that go away with experience?,SmashBrosUltimate

"Made my first montage, what do you think?",[removed],SmashBrosUltimate
In light of recent events,"First of all, props to all the people who aren’t unhygienic and were nice to this poor 15 year old girl after she literally did nothing wrong. Secondly, may not be a popular opinion, but competitive smash ain’t even all that to get mad over. Playing 3 stocks, battlefield stages, and no items over and over again is soooo boring and honestly at that point it’s just like any other fighting game such as mortal kombat or street fighter. I understand why tournaments are like this, but even so it shouldn’t be taken this seriously because at the end of the day, smash bros is…wait for it…a game. I hope she finds her way back to this game because this whole game franchise is amazing and when not taken stick-up-your-ass seriously, it’s a good time.",SmashBrosUltimate
Online is actually just stupid,"I have 4.3 million GSP, got kicked out of elite smash and every time I play a match, the other guy wins because of how shitty and garbage the input lag is online. When I play against AI it’s fine, but when I go online, it takes a whole 2 seconds for one move register and it’s really frustrating, can someone please tell me how to fix this bs lag online?",SmashBrosUltimate

This guy didn’t know any of the crazy desync  Combos but instead used desync for legs trapping He never edge guarded. But when were in neutral all he did was spam side B, I never punished it cause I don’t know how to. He got away with so many side Bs. I never fought a ice climber player before so I was getting bodied. So can you guys help me, I got destroyed so many times by the same player. So can you guys give me any tips for fighting them? I play plant btw",SmashBrosUltimate
Struggling at killing with pretty much everyone,Hey so I’m a pretty trash player that’s just trying to get better and one thing I’ve noticed that I struggle with is killing.

The Hero Release Date Prediction,"I believe that update 4.0 will release either on the third week of July or the fourth week. The reason why I believe this is because of the upcoming amiibo. Isabelle, Poke Trainer, and Pichu are releasing on July 26th so I think they have a chance of releasing along side the Hero, since the next amiibos for smash don’t release until November. But it could be like the last time where it’s just the next 3.0 update. But it is possible that they release it before or on July 26th. What do y’all think?",SmashBrosUltimate

"Ok so I recently got a Switch and Smash, and I just got one thing to say...","The fact that you get punished for people d.cing just killed most of my want to play the game whenver I do get on when my friends can't play. Don't get me wrong the game is great, but man getting banned because 2 people either ragequit on you or just really bad connection between both of us just grinds my gears. I just kinda wanted to vent a little since for such a good game, the fact that happens just blows my mind. I legit haven't felt this mad about any other fighting game with laggy or d.cing because the other person never got punished for it. 

And before anyone ask, no it's not my connection from what I can tell. Never had a problem before with any online game, but if I do get match with someone really far away it will be laggy. So there's that. But the punishment is kinda a fun killer.",SmashBrosUltimate

I made a transition clip using Smash footage!,"i run a small gaming podcast, but occasionally someone needs to use the bathroom or take an important phone call so i made this and thought you guys would enjoy it",SmashBrosUltimate
"I know this is a lame question, but how in the world are you supposed to cope when you’re constantly being frozen and stunned to the point that you cannot defend yourself or even do anything?","There must be some strategy that people who are actually good at these types of games employ to counter constant stunning, by multiple attackers or environmental hazards. At the moment I’m fighting against Fatal Frame Zelda who keeps spawning in the assist that snaps a photo of you, damaging you a lot and freezing you in place. I can usually catch on to strategies fine, but I just don’t know about this. Do I not shield enough, or something? Is there no solution, other than “don’t get stunned”?

I’ve had people introduce me to games like Smash Bros. Ultimate many times, and they seem to know what they’re talking about, but I’ve never gotten any actual advice on what to do about this. I’m not much more than casual, but it would be nice if I could avoid wanting to rage-quit from feeling helpless against a stupid freezing camera.",SmashBrosUltimate

Drama,"Is it just me or are we over saturating the drama recently? Like I understand this week has been shitty for us as a community but giving it this much attention eventually does more harm imo. Things to make clear

-Bocchi is an amazing Isabelle player hope to see them succeed in the future

-Ally is disgusting scum and those defending him make us all look bad

-Etika passing definitely a hard hit for us all within the gaming/YouTube community

Now I can bypass us keeping Etika forever in our hearts and I have no problem seeing him on this sub. But personally I’ve seen like 20 reddit posts describing Ally’s/Bocchi’s situation all saying the same thing for the most part.

I just think the subreddit should transfer back to being B tier memes and cool smash clips or other fresh discussion topics. I’m open to hearing anyone’s thoughts on this.",SmashBrosUltimate

I just don’t understand how background matchmaking can’t take an extra 30 seconds to find something with even remotely accurate parameters.,"This is a classic flagship game. 

This is a billion dollar corporation. 

The idea of “preferred” rules is absurd.

The failure to provide us with at least the option of 1v1, team, or FFA is a massive shortcoming in this game and it sucks the life out of it. I shouldn’t have to play roulette here. 

There are tens of thousands of people playing this game, why are you forcing us into games we don’t want to be in?

I hate items and ults. I do not want to play with them, yet half of my games are made up of items. This is a massive failure on Nintendo’s part.

I doubt they’ll fix it or even see this but generating conversation on the topic is step one, so I’m taking a shot.

A simple fix to Smash online battles?,"The majority of us are frustrated with the GSP system, and the fact that we end up in gimmicky rulesets (items, smash all's, startflags+time battles, etc), and most importantly, OPPONENT LAG. 

Why has Nintendo not added an opt in-out function? Like, pre-battle it says ""[username] wants to fight! Do you accept?"" And shows you their ruleset, and how strong their connection is. I feel like that would be an ultimate buff to an otherwise broken online system.

My main concern is rulesets and connection issues. I end up facing someone with a 2 fps match because they are using McDonald's WiFi, and I either have to quit the match by closing smash and just eat the 30 minute ban, or I have to SD and lose GSP, because I literally cannot play. In the meantime, these guys with this trash connection obviously live with it on the daily basis and end up stomping me out because ""they were born in it, molded by it"".

Is there any possible way to get Nintendo to realize thay a fix like this is absolutely necessary? Seriously, opting out of these garbage connections and rulesets would fix so much for players who actually care about playing online.",SmashBrosUltimate

Stages in Quickplay,"I feel like I haven't seen a lot of people talking about others picking stages that give them a wild advantage online, or in general really.

I played against a Wii Fit on hazardless Pilot Wings. I never really had a problem with the stage until then. It's the perfect stage for certain characters to throw out projectiles. They can hide under the wings, forcing you to approach. Which is dangerous because you *have* to fall through the platform to do anything. 

Are there any other stages that gives certain characters a wild advantage due to how it's laid out? Not going to use them because I like having fun playing competitively. Just curious because I've never had this problem before.",SmashBrosUltimate

Could Hyness be a DLC fighter,"This is not a leak or fact, this is just a theory.


Many people are only speculating third party characters for Smash Bros, however many are ignoring some missing first party characters.

Reggie stated that the DLC characters would be characters we wouldn't expect for Smash Bros, so that doesn't deconfirm first party characters. 

For those that don't know who Hyness is, he is the primary antagonist of Kirby Star Allies, which came out in 2018. He is a significant character and is very relevant to the franchise, yet he still lacks any form of representation in Smash Bros Ultimate. 

Even more confusing, the Three Mage Sisters (which were Hyness's servants) are a spirit in World of light. 

As I said before, this isn't proven, and he might not become playable. But he does have a lot going for him. His spirit was purposefully left out of the game, he is a major antagonist in the franchise (being directly linked to Dark Matter), he does have quite a bit of moveset potential, and the Kirby franchise hasn't had a new character since Brawl. 

This is purely speculation, and none of this is fact. This is all just my thoughts on the next DLC characters",SmashBrosUltimate

Proto Man for Smash Ultimate,"ok im really bad at writing so i apologize for any twisted knickers.

***WHY?***

With Joker, Banjo and The Luminary all being... *interesting* pieces of DLC, many people have suggested outlandish smash fighters such as Steve, Heavy, Doomguy and Gordon Freeman. However, sometimes I think it's better to add a simpler, more down-to-earth third-party fighter. That being Proto Man. First appearing in Mega Man 3 as ""Break Man"", Proto Man would continue to have minor cameos in 4, 6, 7 and 8. In Mega Man 9 and 10, however, Proto Man finally became playable for the first time in the Classic Mega Man series. please shut up about spirits

***PLAYSTYLE***

Proto Man would most likely be a more zoning-based character with a shield that works similarly to the Links. However, Red M&amp;M will take increased knockback, as to give him some sort of drawback that fits with his lore. For his actual moveset, he should reflect the games where he is playable/has a major role, such as 3, 5, 9 and 10.

***MOVESET:***

**NEUTRALS:**

\-When Idling, your iconic Proto Shield is out, which blocks attacks in front of you.

\-His base-neutral, side-tilt and neutral-air are all the same, the ~~Proto Buster~~ Tangerine Cannon. These shots are fired at a much slower rate than Mega's lemons, but pack a stronger punch.

\-While down-tilt could just be a regular slide, to spice things up, Proto Man will have Charge Kick as a D-Tilt. Charge Kick has fiery particles surrounding the user upon use, so perhaps this could make his D-Tilt deals fire damage as opposed to the regular Mega D-Tilt.

\-Proto's up-tilt could potentially be Thunder Wool, a cloud of static wool which flies upwards. Perhaps this would continuously fly upwards and deal repeatedly zap enemies, but have a good amount of endlag to compensate.

\-F-Air will make him spins forwards and launch three powerful boulders that arc downwards, an homage to Power Stone.

\-Back-air shunts Proto backwards (slightly) as he unleashes Tengu Blade. While it may not have too far of a reach, it can spike enemies.

\-Up-air launches a Rebound Striker directly upwards. While this thanos-testicle lookin' fool might not deal too much damage, it has very high knockback and can juggle enemies in the air.

\-Dash attack makes him do the Break Dash from Mega Man 5 (on the gameboy lmao), a shoulder dash weapon with short coverage but high damage.

\-An optional tether weapon could be the Wire Adaptor from Mega Man 4, albeit horizontal instead of vertical.

**SPECIALS:**

\-Neutral Special is the Shadow Blade from Mega Man 3. This works similarly to the custom move in SSB4.

\-Side Special is Gyro Attack from Mega Man 5. A slow projectile, but upon contacting an enemy, the propeller flies up, activating a small windbox around it.

\-Down Special is the Search Snake, not to be confused with the human Snake. These small snakes travel along surfaces, and cut up enemies who touch them, before disappearing.

\-For a recovery, the Tornado Blow could work. He already has a strong tether, so a weakened version of this weapon could make up for it.

**SMASH ATTACKS:**

\-Side Smash is the hot and ready Magma Bazooka. This attack has two charges, a virgin 3-projectile shotgun, and a chad 3-projectile shotgun. Deals fire damage.

\-Up Smash is the Pharoah Shot from Mega Man 4. This miniature sun gains size upon increasing, and always flies directly upwards. The hitbox could also allow for nearby enemies to get caught in it.

\-Down Smash is the all-american Napalm Bomb. Upon releasing charge Proto Man lobs a strong explosive directly at his feet, launching anyone who is close to the explosion.

**GRABS:**

\-FThrow throws the enemy forward. Idiot.

\-BThrow throws the enemy backwards. Imbecile.

\-UThrow kicks the enemy at an upwards angle, depending on where Proto is facing.

\-DThrow lets Proto Man pull out Wheel Cutter, rip through an enemy, and launch them at a low angle.

**FINAL SMASH:**

Proto Man's whistle plays as he flicks his scarf at nearby enemies. Upon getting hit by his scarf, the Dark Men (1 through 4, count them) repeatedly bombard a victim in a cutscene, before Proto Man finishes them off with a massive charge shot.

And it’s for more than just Smash Bros. I experience this with other competitive games that I’ve played for a long time, and I also experience it socially and in school. How do 
I get past this? 

Me saying this doesn’t mean that I have a superiority complex, as I always feel like I suck even though I win against my friends in casual matches most of the time. I have a bad history of quitting after the first or second stock that I loose because, judging by how the person plays and how I played, I can “tell” that I will loose. If I don’t quit then I run the risk of getting tilted because I lost and felt like I couldn’t do anything about it. This is also why I stay away from competitive, as I know I will get my a*s kicked (like it was in a local tournament I visited last summer) and I will feel the same way as I said in the previous paragraph.

Sorry if this feels rambly, I basically improvised this entire thing.",SmashBrosUltimate

Banjo &amp; Kazooie SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE MOVESET,"This is my moveset concept for Banjo Kazooie in SMASH.
And no. They are not just a glorified duck hunt for those of you who actually think that, banjo and kazooie are way to unique to be a simple duck hunt clone, though the moves that are not from in the game will be taken from or be inspired by other characters mostly Mario and duck hunt, simply because banjo &amp; kazooie's moveset is very similar to duck hunts in that the character is two that work together and Mario because they are both from very similar games so if there is no move for banjo, for example let's say that banjo does not have an up air I will take Mario's one and tweak it to be more banjo kazooie like so instead kicking upwards he will use kazooie's wings and ""slice"" the air, I will be addressing when I do that but most of the moveset had already been completed for me in banjo kazooie and every move I see similarities with a move that is already in smash I will reference that so you can imagine how it will look in game.


Neutral 

A: Claw Swipe
the basic 1 2 3 hit like in Banjo Kazooie, banjo moves abit forwards when using it just like in the game, the move finishes with kazooie doing a poke rapid jab similar to duck hunt.

Dash attack: Forward Roll
Banjo Rolls on the ground like he does in game, can travel a preaty long distance with it, very much like snakes dash attack.

《》: Breegull Whack 
banjo kill use kazooie and his backpack as a two hit combo, where he swings his backpack sideways puts it back on and slashes with kazooie, like Links forward tilt.

/\: Punch &amp; Wing Flap
Banjo hits the opponent infront of him upwards then kazooie combos that in to two wing flaps, like charizards up smash and a chain attack similar to jokers up tilt. 

\/: Kick
banjo does a kick just like Mario does.


SPECIALS

B: Egg Shot
Kazooie shoots an egg from her beak forwards, can be shot rapidly but only 4 eggs on screen at once, the eggs travel preaty far (about half of battlefield) and after that they shader like in banjo kazooie.

《》: WonderWing
a temporary shield using golded feathers max is ten and they charge over time, lasts 10 seconds (one for every second) if stopped will continue from the same amount of feathers and only refills after all feathers had been deployed, charge time is 20 seconds (1 for every two seconds) will also give a boost in speed for that 10 seconds.

/\: Flight 
Banjo and Kazooie jump like they do on a flight pad then they fly upwards, like Pit/Dark Pit's up Special.

\/: Beak Barge/ Bill Drill 
Banjo ducks and chargers forwards with kazooie who goes head first into the enemy, and if used in the air it turns into Bill Drill and spins fast and heads towards the ground, like corins down air.


AERIALS

N-air: Rat-a-tat Rap
A three hit move that has Kazooie stretch her neck and peck the opponent, it will be a good horizontal recovery move because it stops your downwards momentum and let's you move horizontally but you will be able to use it only once in the air to stall your fall, it is similar to snakes n-air as a three hit n-air

F-air: Beak Bomb
Banjo and Kazooie do a small charge forwards before returning to their original positions 

B-air: Turbo Talon Trot
Kazooie puts on the Turbo Talon Trat shoes and runs in plays when kazooie's feet are faced backwards, it's the same as yoshi's n-air just from a different position

U-air: Beak Buster 
Kazooie rushes upwards head first like the ground pound in banjo kazooie just that here its upwards, exactly like king k.rool's up air 

D-air: Wading Boots
Kazooie stomps the opponent downwards with the boots, the move has an average spike power, not the worst nor the best, looks like any character's stomp D-air


SMASH ATTACKS

Up Smash: Shock Spring Jump 
Banjo and kazooie chage like they are about to jump from a shock spring pad when released they jump up a bit and attack anyone who's above them or very close.

Side Smash: Swim 
Kazooie is on banjos back and banjo is low on the ground, then kazooie flaps her wings forwards like she is swimming.

Down Smash: Talon Trot 
Kazooie carries banjo and is charging a split that will hit anyone on both sides of them.

TAUNTS:

《》: Banjo sits down and plays a game boy with Kazooie looks at the game from behind him.

/\: Mumbo Jumbo appears and transforms banjo into one of 6 things: a termite, a crocodile, a walrus, a pumpkin, a bee and a washing machine, (one of these things is not like the other) and then Mumbo turns them back when the taunt ends, the transformations are randomized.

\/: Banjo and Kazooie do the little dance they do everytime they get a jiggy in game.


OTHER

Entrance Animation: Jiggy Worp
Banjo and Kazooie appear on a jiggy looking platform with it disappearing after they jump off of it to enter the battle, the entering of banjo and kazooie uses the same effects from the og game just updated.

Victory Animations:
#1: Jiggy Get Dance 
Banjo and Kazooie do the dance they do when they get a jiggy.

#2: Note Door, Unlocked 
Banjo and Kazooie do the little dance they do when they unlock a note door or get all 10 jiggs in a level.

#3: Break Time For the Heros
The camera zooms in to see Banjo and Kazooie chilling with a smoothie and sunglasses on a beach chair then smiling at the camera.

Grab and pumle: Hold and Peck
banjo holds the opponent in place while kazooie packs them.

Throws:
Forward: Banjo holds the opponent and let's Kazooie peck them once to send them flying.

Backward: Banjo throws the opponent behind him and Kazooie pushes them with her wings.

Upward: Banjo throws the opponent to Kazooie, and Kazooie head-butts him upwards.

Downward: Banjo jumps up, throws the opponent on the ground and uses Beak Buster (a basic ground pound move) to bury the opponent for a short while, like R.O.B's down throw.

Other Animations:

Jumping: the same jump from his games 

Double Jump: the same double jump from his game just that now it reaches a lot higher then in the og game, and if you hold the jump button you will glide for a short while, similar to peach and Daisy's up special.

Shielding: kazooie covers banjo like in the game when they use the Wonder Wing

Spot Dodge: Banjo steps backwards with a confused expression on his face.

Dodge Roll: the same rolling animation from his dash attack.

Air Dodge: looks like he moved his body to avoid the hazard and has a confused expression on his face.

Grabbing the ledg: the same animation for grabbing a ledg from Banjo-Tooie.

Ledg attack: Banjo pops up punches the opponent then Kazooie comes out of the backpack and pokes him

Stage get ups: every ledg get up is almost the exact same as all the other fighters except the ledg attack, that animation is completely unique for each character.

Knock Down: the same way he lies on the ground after he gets hit in his game 

Knock down get ups:
Normal: just gets up as all characters do
Back attack: has Kazooie poke the opponent while Banjo recovers.
Front attack: Banjo kicks the opponent off of him.
Both sides: both back get up and front get up attacks are done simultaneously.

Hit Stun: the same hit stun effect from his games.

Free Fall: the same animation that banjo does when he is falling from a high place in his games.

Walk/Run: 
The same Animations from his games

Idle animation: the same ones from his games

Crouch: the same animation from his game, does not have a scrolling animation

And I think that this is it, I'm preaty sure I got every animation I needed to, done, if i forgot something, and animation, an attack anything I've missed please tell so I can fix it.

As you can tell, I really was Banjo Kazooie in smash bros and for good reasons, banjo kazooie is one of my favorite games of all time, I love the character and well, what I made here shows how unique banjo can be, and this is just one of many moveset concepts that other people have made, so there is demand, potential and history with the big N for banjo and as we know Microsoft and Nintendo have been in good relations lately so we are probably getting a Microsoft rep in smash any way but boy I'm so stressed out about this, I'm just so scared that banjo &amp; kazooie won't make it but Steve or master chief, of course I'm never angry at a new addition to smash but as a Microsoft rep, the most important one to get is Banjo Kazooie as he is the most ""Nintendo character"" out of all of them but only time will tell.

And one more thing I didn't bother detailing the animations that are the same as in banjo kazooie because it would just take too long, so if you don't know what move I'm talking about, go to YouTube and search for ""Banjo Kazooie/Tooie and name of the move/animation you are looking to see
Also for those of you who haven't yet played through banjo kazooie, you should play it, it's an awesome game and if he is in smash you will appreciate how they made him even more then you will if you haven't played through the game, just like P5, I appreciated everything more after I was done with P5 because I new where the things came from and had prior knowledge on the character and his game.

All and all I want is banjo &amp; kazooie in smash bros ultimate, they are my number one pick for DLC and will always be there until they are in, so please sakurai, Nintendo and Microsoft please let my beloved banjo to super smash bros ultimate. That's all I have for today this thing took me a whole day to write and I hope it was worth it (by that I mean that people agree with most of the stuff I say and also are on the same boat when it comes to banjo in smash) hope you agree with me on banjo in smash.",SmashBrosUltimate

Am I a bad Link if I use my specials just as much as I use my meele's? New player here sry.,"I have just recently gotten into SBU and i'm still learning the terminology, sorry. I have gotten my link to 2.2m so I feel im doing pretty good as him, mainly because I cannot play anyone else. I can't play other characters past 8 on CPU. When I Play link and using his specials I kick ass, again, I feel at least. Aswell I also feel I may use his tuff too much. I am always attacking with my specials before I hit with melee unless the opponent rushes me. Now I know what camping is, I am not camping, I swear. I attack with melee just as much, but I am always trying to keep the enemy at bay so they can't come close and attack me first. I like to set them up by hitting them with the specials and making them move places so I can create an opening to attack. I ledge trap like a bitch too with only specials so I know for a fact that pisses people off but I know that is something a lot of link players do. I haven't been beaten by another link yet although i've only played against 4, They didn't use their specials as much as me. I don't want to be a Belmont spammer as link but unless I add my opponents after the match and ask for a review, I dunno how to tell if i'm an asshole link or not.   


I also kinda spam UP B Alot when people recover and are above me. I either try to move them to the edge with specials or I cant them with UP B. Many people has escapes like dash or attacks that move them.

I think that the next fighter will be announced this month and released shortly after (less than a month). because joker was announced on November then there was silence from Nintendo. then suddenly a direct-video about joker then he was released the next day. so there is a possibility. and also the DLC fighters were already planned from before so it.s believable that the next 2 fighters are already in development",SmashBrosUltimate

I tried Battle Arena and I love it but I wonder if...,"Hey guys... 

&amp;#x200B;

Quick question!

&amp;#x200B;

I have started making battle arenas, and as soon as I see someone spamming his way out, I leave the match and kick him. I'd rather get bodied by combos than playing vs this. 

Considering I can find this kind of playstyle in quickplay whenever I queue (almost all the time I play there), do you consider it ok to kick people who play this way? Just like online isn't optimal for learning purposes, I think falling in the pattern of being used to play against players who mostly spam is bad for practice.

  
Obviously you have to get good against people with this playstyle, but I could find that anytime I want just by queuing quickplay.

  
I've been playing BA recently and I prefer the practice there, I think my joker improve quite a bit just in two days, especially because I get to choose if someone bodies me with great play vs frustrating gameplay.

I KNOW it might be boring for the guy who gets kicked for this, but unless I get to elite smash, I'll never play against the players I wanted to learn from (the same type of players I found in the single tournament I played so far)

I'm starting to invest more time in the game, I'll substitute as much online as possible with people in weeklies, because I want to get better.

GSP and spam isn't healthy for me right now because I get angry, once I get confident I think I'll be fine playing the waiting game.

I made a website to collect/share matchup opinions and knowledge. It's called The Contingency Plan.,"Hey guys, not sure if this is the right place to drop things like this, but I recently made a simple website where people can submit matchup opinions and tips on how to play matchups.

&amp;#x200B;

I just started playing Smash with Ultimate and it's also my first fighting game, so i'm quite new. That being said, i've been enjoying it quite a lot but I noticed that there's quite a range of opinions regarding who has the advantage or disadvantage when talking about matchups. With this in mind, I thought it would be interesting if there was a site where everyone could contribute their opinions and you could see everyone's views all in one place. I also thought it would be cool if people could find useful information on how to play each matchup on the site too. That's how I ended up making it.

&amp;#x200B;

There's two main features of the website, which is the Matchup Judging system that allows people to submit their opinions on each matchup, and the Contingency system, which allows people to submit tips (I call them Contingencies) on how to play any matchup.

&amp;#x200B;

There's still a few things left I need to work on, like making a detailed guide on how to use the website, but for now I think it should be fine to open it to the public and let people play around with it. I'm also not the best developer, so I can't guarantee everything will work perfectly. I'll still be working on making the site better whenever I have the time.

There was even a smash bros reference in deltarune (just like there was in persona 5!). Sans wouldn’t get in because fighting just isn’t his thing, it wouldn’t be true to his personality to just fight. I think papyrus would be a perfect fit, he would fight because he wants to prove himself a hero, and his personality would be more fun.

Porky Minch. Porky is the only smash bros boss battle that is not directly referenced AT ALL (the rest are at least spirits). I find it likely that he will be announced alongside an announcement for Mother 3 release in America, Porky being a character in part to advertise it.

Minecraft Steve. I’ll admit, Minecraft has been a huge part of my childhood, so I am a bit biased toward him. But you can not deny the huge impact this once small indie game has had on the gaming world. It dominated YouTube, and inspired an age of creators and memes. Steve could have huge versatility of his move set, and would be representing another huge part of the gaming community. Don’t forget, Minecraft is making a comeback (especially with the 2 new Minecraft games in the works), so it’s still very relevant today! Maybe he could be announced at Minecon this year?

Waluigi. I know a lot of people call him a joke character and that he’s not getting in, but you have to admit, Waluigi has been the most petitioned for smash bros character (whether seriously or for memes). He could still be a very fun character (representing the Mario sport and party games). If he is getting in, he will defiantly be the last character announced for the battle pass. Image in February 2020, Waluigi is announced. There would be a huge celebration that he got in, and convince those who have not bought the pass to buy it, alongside the rest of the new characters. Waluigi getting in would just bring even more attention to this masterpiece of a game.

The Knight from Hollow Knight: His “soul” mechanic if would be new and fun to implement into smash, having to use weak nail slashes to build up soul to unleash your super powerful b moves (spells). Would represent yet another much of gaming.

That’s my take. What do you think, reddit? Have any ideas on why my characters could/ could not get in?",SmashBrosUltimate

Can't land anywhere because she is so fast and just launches you back immediately. Can't attack her in the air because all of her moves have ridiculous range and she has a counter special.

Can't grab the ledge because she will spam explosive flare to zone you out...

Mii gun fighter bug?,"One of Mii gun fighter's abilities is literally impossible to see on certain stages because of it's color. It's pretty hard to see unless the stage background is like black. I don't know if I'm color blind or something, but it's extremely annoying. The character is already rip off somehow campier Samus that people only play when they want to be annoying online. Why would they make one of their abilities so hard to see? All you have to go off of is the sound of it and that's barely anything. I don't understand why they put resources into making the mii fighters when all they do is steal abilities from other characters or have really bad looking low budget abilites. They could've made an actual Mii fighter that's based off of things like miitopia, that one mii apartment game, wii sports, and stuff like that. I don't understand why they thought, oh no, let's just make them annoying rip offs instead. Miis are something that have a lot of nostalgia related to them because of games like mii sports and just hanging out in the mii plaza. We have plenty of content to use to make a legit mii character. We have characters that are nothing but yoga poses, they could've came up with something else. The miis were a mistake, especially the mii gun fighter and their invisible abilities.

Ken and Lucario players: advice?,"So I used to play a lot of Ken at release but let go of him, but I couldn't remember why... but now I do. The patch didn't change my personal issues with him: his command inputs...

Am I the only one having a real hard time to not accidentally make his tatsumaki instead of doing a backair? I mean in online with the lag. Whenever I go in training mode it's fine. But as soon as I go in quickplay, it's almost impossible. 

Not only that, but the idea of him never turning his back om his enemies is actually more of a downside to me than a pro. I feel like it messes up the mix ups more. Especially in low rank, people will ignore you backstepping. They won't feel a 'run away' vibe at all. 

I really think Ken's special command inputs should be only woth B, and his tilt commands should be as they are now on A. It would make him a lot less confusing. 

Lucario: his mechanic is so awkward to play still: he gets stronger as he takes more damage. Cool. But he dies from almost anything at 80%... or is that just me? Plus, I still feel like all his moves have still super tiny hitboxes. Any suggestions? What are actually safe moves from him?

Dash Attack - Reduced vulnerability (33 -&gt; 30)

Forward Tilt - Increased power (hit 2: 8 -&gt; 9), reduced base knockback by 10% to compensate (overall, base knockback will remain slightly higher than it was before)

Side Special - Increased power (14 -&gt; 15), reduced base knockback by 5% to compensate

Down Special - Reduced vulnerability of successful use (47 -&gt; 45)

Other - Increased initial dash speed (2.365 -&gt; 2.464), increased weight (87 -&gt; 88)",SmashBrosUltimate

"I recently had a hyper-realistic dream about the next DLC reveal. I'm just going to post it here, so I have proof later if I'm a prophet or not.","I had an extremely vivid dream a couple nights ago about the next reveal.

There are two guys (like 20-ish) enjoying Smash on the switch. One of them is playing Bayonetta, and the other guy goes ""Man you always pick the newer characters! I prefer the old-school ones!"" 

Suddenly, a blank fighter slot appears on the fighter select screen. The two guys give each other a quizzical look, and the non-Bayo player picks it for shits and giggles. There's a flash on the screen, and a movie plays:

 

Some veteran fighters (Mario and DK) are fighting on the Yoshi's Island stage, with [athletic theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcSv2wJGQy8) playing in the background.

DK punches mario so hard he crashes through the camera (the camera is angled so it's right at stage level) and into the foreground off screen. You hear crashing and the breaking of instruments. Mario walks back into shot, holding broken pieces of wood with a disappointed face.

Cut to the fighters trying out different instruments for their fighting escapades. Yink tries his ocarina; wario tries plays an electric guitar; ROB tries playing an eletronic tune. It doesn't work - nothing matches the tone of Yoshi's island.

DK thinks hard, then has a lightbulb moment. We see him and mario put the iconic smash invitation letter into a mailbox. Mario flashes DK a concerned look, and he returns a big grin.

Shortly after, cut to the fighters practicing without music. Suddenly, they hear a faint strum of a stringed instrument. 

Everyone stops in their tracks.

The instrument gets louder and louder. Soon, it's clear what the instrument is. The camera pans, and there he is.

Some match ups work better than other, but for the main bulk of the roster you just get destroyed at very low percent. I'm not saying she needs a buff, but they need to nerf everyone else if they don't.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone have any tips? I sit comfortably around 4m with inkling/falco/mii gunner but cant get sheik above 500k. 150 games and I'm just about breaking even with the win/loss.

DON-CHAN as a fighter,"Since a new character announcement may be happening very soon, I would like to share my character concept for Ultimate: Don-Chan. (I'll be doing this formally)

  

Introduction: Don-Chan is a  drum that appears in *Taiko no Tatsujin*, a rhythm game developed and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. It was released as an arcade game in Japan, but has been released onto consoles, including Wii, 3DS, Wii U, and Nintendo Switch, where the Switch version was released in the West for the first time in over a decade.

 

Move Set (Standard): His standard attacks will mainly consist of punches and kicks, kind of like Mario.

  

Move Set (Special): 

* Neutral: Don wields a sword (or possibly a drumstick). He has a sword in a [Japanese exclusive 3DS game](https://taiko.fandom.com/wiki/Taiko_no_Tatsujin:_Little_Dragon_and_the_Mysterious_Orbs). (DISCLAIMER: I have not played that game) 
* Side:  Can't figure something out for this, but maybe some sort of launch mechanic, similar Mii Brawler's Side Special.
* Up: His Up Special will consist of him inflating a balloon, where he will float up a good distance. This is based on the Balloon Note in his game. 
* Down: In his game, Don does a dance while there appears to be some “fire” at the note target yielding the player some bonus points (no clue what it’s called). Don will do this with his Down Special, yielding similar results to DK’s Down Special.

  

Final Smash: Don’s Final Smash would be some sort of drum roll, either A) Drum sticks continuously hitting the stage for a period of time, or B) Hit characters would fall onto a drum (this would be a cut-scene smash) and drum sticks would continually hit them, dealing them a good amount of damage, possibly.

  

Stage: Don-Chan’s stage will be set at some Japanese carnival at night, as that is what the Switch’s version game is set in the Menus (as well as the PS4 in game). In the original game, the cast of characters jump up and down when the soul gage of a song is at 100%. This could be incorporated into the stage when the match is almost over (15-30 seconds left).

  

The only problem with this character is music for the stage and victory screen, as music from *Taiko no Tatsuin* is mainly from actual artists, mainly Japanese artists/Anime/Vocaloids. Although there are original Bandai Namco original songs in the song list in game, I can’t think of an original *Taiko no Tatsujin* song, and when they do add new songs in *Drum and Fun* (and I’m guessing PS4 version as well), it takes some time for it to come to the West, likely due to licensing.",SmashBrosUltimate
Diddy Kong Buffs?,"Lads, I see Diddy Kong getting some decent buffs now. But my question is, is he viable for comp now? People I've talked to about it say no, and it seems like Zero agrees, despite being happy Diddy is getting some love. So ye, discuss. Is Diddy comp viable now?",SmashBrosUltimate

Professor Layton costume (I would love for this guy to be a fighter though, but I don't think he will now)

Resident Evil costumes (they'd be based on Chris, Leon and Jill, and although I can see these guys getting in Smash as fighters I can't think of what they're stage would be)

"If a certain Dragon Quest rep isn't added at E3, my only request of people is to stop making excuses for you know who.","Posting here since r/smashbros is worthless

I personally believe that past December 6th, 11:59.59, was the last we could trust Vergeben, I've been adamant on such, he said the GA character would be someone who wasn't the GA character, and so far people who think Verge is God's gift to Earth have said the following.

&gt;The reveal being last minute means they were planning on revealing Erdrick first supporting his theory. Additionally, considering we didn't see any footage until he was shadowdropped, this means they were working on the real Pack 1 first.

Or, it's entirely possible that they didn't plan on having a reveal in the first place, this was the common consensus among the sub before the GA, even past the sub nobody except the optimists were expecting a huge reveal.

&gt;Erdrick is probably gonna be shadowdropped with Joker, because if Verge is to be believed, he was switched with Joker.

Having played the April DLC for a month and a half now, I must say I'm a proud Erdrick main. Shame MKLeo is using the second character in the pass instead of the OG.

&gt;Erdrick is the one character fully supported by leaks from Vergeben, I trust that he's in.

Remember when Erdrick was only one of 7 potential square reps? It wasn't until several leaks containing info on both Erdrick and Joker had surfaced that he set his mind on this character.

This is exactly what has happened, while at one point the only way to have your leak taken seriously was to piggyback off of Vergeben, this is what he has resulted to for DLC. Erdrick's now the Ken of Smash DLC leaks, every leak has him and he's heavily expected at this rate.

Look, I'm not saying the dude is destined to be wrong here, and if the show opens with an Erdrick reveal then feel free to come back here and shit all over me. But he got something pretty big wrong and every excuse people have used on him has been pretty flimsy. Hype responsibily.


Also: Should Erdrick be shadowdropped after the E3 conference like people are expecting fighter 2 to be, I will solo main him until fighter 3 is released. If fighter 3 is announced and released the same day, I will wait until fighter 4 is released, so on and so forth.",SmashBrosUltimate
Would you download an android app for finding ultimate tournaments and hosting meetups for other ultimate players?,"I was thinking of creating almost a social networking app for melee/ultimate players.

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Paper Mario Moveset Idea,"I know that he is already a spirit in Smash, so I made this only for fun. Paper Mario himself is one of my most wanted for the next game (along with Waluigi).

So without further ado, this is my moveset idea:

&amp;nbsp;

**Neutral A:** Hammer

**Forward Tilt:** Watt's Electro Dash, instant little shock attack

**Up Tilt:** Cooking Mistake, deals 1% damage to enemies or recover 1% to self

**Down Tilt:** Hammer Down Swing, a golf club-like attack, can be used to attack ledge enemies

&amp;nbsp;

**Forward Smash:** Spinning Super Hammer, hold it to bend his body to powerfully knocks front enemies

**Up Smash:** Spring Jump, hold it to jumps super high and attack above enemies

**Down Smash:** Quake Hammer, hold it to deals some damage (and shield damage) to all enemies on the ground (with timing sound effect), deal extra damage when the buttons released right after the timing indicator is full

&amp;nbsp;

**Neutral Air:** Jump Command, Paper Mario hurts enemies when stomping on them, deal extra damage when pressing A right before stomping on them

**Forward Air:** Barry, hurts enemies while also reflect projectiles

**Back Air:** Flurrie's Body Slam, massive boobs attack!

**Up Air:** Tornado Jump, a spin jump attack that gain extra height, based on his PM64 Ultra Boots ability

**Down Air:** Hammer Spike, a meteor hammer attack

&amp;nbsp;

**Grab:** Thoreau, a ranged grab move, can be used to grab item

**Pummel:** Lady Bow's Smack, slaps an enemy multiple times

**Forward Throw:** Lift, a Donkey Kong-like move, based on his SPM Thoreau ability

**Back Throw:** Yoshi Kid's Gulp, the move launches an enemy to behind Paper Mario

**Up Throw:** Hammer Uppercut, forcefully knocks an enemy upward with hammer

**Down Throw:** Ground Pound, based on his PM64 Super Boots ability

&amp;nbsp;

**Dash Attack:** Spin Dash, spins horizontally unlike Sonic

**Ledge Attack:** Hammer Sweep, a Peach's down tilt-like attack

**Spot Dodge:** Paper Mode, turns sideway

**Roll:** Tube Mode, becomes a paper roll

&amp;nbsp;

**Passive:** Badges, Paper Mario will uses one of his badges when doing certain attacks in a row (the pattern will resets if he get his badge): 

- Throw, Air, Special, Smash, Tilt: Removes his current badge

- Tilt, Throw, Air, Special, Smash: Close Call, makes him sometimes dodge enemy's attacks when his % is above 100

- Smash, Tilt, Throw, Air, Special: Slow Go, slow his movement down

- Special, Smash, Tilt, Throw, Air: Double Pain, double the damage he takes

- Air, Special, Smash, Tilt, Throw: Attack FX R, change his hammer sound effects to something that start with ""cr"" and end with ""icket""

&amp;nbsp;

**Neutral B:** Hammer Throw, hold to launch farther, the direction can be controlled by moving the control stick while holding

**Side B:** Koops's Shell Toss, kicks the shell, hold to holds him in place, after releasing it, he will be coming back at super speed, can be used to pick item

**Up B:** Parakarry's Air Lift, a Snake-like move based on Parakarry's Super Rank ability (where Paper Mario grabs his hand to fly upward)

**Down B:** Boomer, a Snake-like move, except it can't be attached to wall or enemy, counts as item (so it can be picked by Thoreau or Koops)

**Final Smash:** Mega Star, Paper Mario grabs the star to turns into a giant 8-bit self and then charges forward

&amp;nbsp;

**Entrance:** Paper Airplane

**Idle:** Fixing his cap, sweeping the dust, looking around

&amp;nbsp;

**Taunt 1:** Angry, Paper Mario is angry

**Taunt 2:** No No No, moving his index finger

**Taunt 3:** Goombella's Tattle, shows brief description of the closest enemy

&amp;nbsp;

**Winning 1:** Thumb Up, with the last used partner celebrating beside him

**Winning 2:** Get a Pure Heart, Paper Mario claiming red pure heart above him with dancing pixls beside him

**Winning 3:** Stylish, doing a hammer attack, back flips, and then raise both his hands, the audience cheers, followed by spotlight and falling paper pieces

&amp;nbsp;

**Alt 1:** Default

**Alt 2:** Paper Luigi

**Alt 3:** Paper Wario

**Alt 4:** Paper Waluigi

**Alt 5:** Fire Paper Mario

**Alt 6:** Ice Paper Mario

**Alt 7:** Mr. L

**Alt 8:** Shadow Paper Mario

Habits/characters?,"I noticed I am usually insanely aggressive and it gets me killed constantly (I roll occasionally, I air dodge, but I basically nevee shield and I NEVER get grabs off) so I am trying Mario and Doc, but I'm not sure which to try.

So I'm not sure who to play, should I try fixing aggressive habits and play Mario, or work with my natural play style and do Doc? Also should I try grabbing more?

Why Gunvolt makes the most sense as DLC.,"1. He would be a new IP.
2. Sakurai has [said](https://twitter.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1118342920979927042) that the new DLC characters will bring many new spirits to Smash from their respective franchises, so this raises Gunvolt's chances as he is a new character. Sadly, this likely deconfirms characters like Porky and Geno who are already part of well-represented franchises.
3. [Gunvolt exists on the Switch.](https://www.ebay.com/p/Azure-Striker-Gunvolt-Striker-Pack-Nintendo-Switch-2017/239045040?thm=1000&amp;chn=ps)
4. Shovel Knight is an assist trophy in Smash and is also a [boss by using an amiibo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pvLdJ4-VSw)
5. Nobody would expect it (in the same vein as Joker and Pirahna Plant).
6. If you listen carefully, Sakurai specifies that the fighters would be brand new characters from [scratch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnOrvi0izVI) This would perfectly describe Gunvolt since his [moveset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgl_h2eORLw) would be unlike anything we have ever seen before.

Optimal Controller design (inspired by u/KingMuu),"KingMuu made a post earlier about an alternative pro controller design, so I took a stab at it.

&amp;#x200B;

I miss the octagon gates on the pro controller. also, modern controllers in general do not conform to how the thumbs work. You end up having to do weird thumb movements just to get basic left, right, up, down movement. Especially when switching between left stick and d pad, or when using the C-stick/ right stick. Also the pro controllers ABXY buttons didn't line up with the thumbs radius.

I would love to see Chrono Trigger in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate more than Dragon Quest,"Why? Mainly because I love that game A LOT. Plus, if Chrono Trigger got represented in Smash it would put to rest the argument that a character has to be relevant in order to be in Smash. Can you just imagine Chrono Trigger returning, but in SSBU? I know Dragon Quest does seem more likely to be represented, but Chrono Trigger would open the door for other irrelevant video game characters. Crono himself would be such an amazing fighter. And the music, that Chrono Trigger music, oh my God (the music alone makes me wish Chrono Trigger gets represented in Smash). And I'll say one thing that could help Crono's chances is the sheer popularity of his game. Granted, Dragon Quest III did beat Chrono Trigger on that one poll, but it did come in third place, and for a game that came out almost 30 years ago, and has only one sequel that's pretty surprising.",SmashBrosUltimate

I don't know why, but I'm also better at fast falling and general timing when using X as a jump button and A for my aerials.

No, that doesn't happen... obviously you would say the solution is to have dedicated servers But no... that also won't fix it even if it was great because you won't be fighting globally because you will connect to either the US, Europe, Asia, it's not global even with the dedicated servers. ""Global"" smash power makes no sense because you are not fighting people globally, you're only fighting against your own region therefore you might not find balance matches because you might have 4650M gsp and there's no one in your region even hit 4500 (i live in KSA and trust me nobody did...) which makes reaching to elite smash in my region almost impossible and the outcomes and the elite smash matches are not great because i don't find elite smash opponents everytime... and that's not because my region is bad and it's my fault that i live in this region and everyone else is in a good one and everyone go home... No, it's a problem for everyone too. also the ruleset system makes it even worse and worse and worse, Just simple. add for glory with leaderboards just like smash 4, and for god's sake why can't i invite my friend to team battle online? weren't you be able to do that in smash 4's team smash? why do u have to find him randomly now? didn't they both use peer-to-peer therefore it didn't allow for region cross? why is not allowed now?

Some new features/ dlc I want added to Super Smash Bros Ultimate:,"I would like the feature of custom colors for character alts. This feature would allow for players to take any character of their choice and as I said earlier customize their colors. It would add more variety to the mix, instead of everyone playing as the Blood Falcon alt. The inclusion of dlc alts for characters [ EX: Luigi can have a Mr. L alt ] would allow for what I think would be cool aesthetic changes. This would of course not have that character’s true move sets not be included [EX: Having BOTW Link have his OOT apparel but without the grappling hook or bombs]. I’d rather have this be free since with Olimar/ Alph (of course) doesn’t have a pay wall to access both of them, but it would make too much sense for Nintendo to take advantage of that and have there be a pay wall.

Are there any other ideas that you amazing people might have.",SmashBrosUltimate

SSB character RNG fusion mod?,"The recent posts from r/snickferdoodle got me wondering if it was too much of a stretch to create a mod project where you would play a match with a character created out of 2 other random characters, sharing movesets randomly mixed in a 50/50 distribution.
How hard would it actually be to start working in such a project, and what tools would I need?",SmashBrosUltimate

how to turn around faster (and turn around in the air),"The question is pretty simple, is there a setting I can change to let my orientation turn around faster on the ground and also in the air. During matches it messes me up sometimes when I mis-input due to character orientation. sometimes as Joker I will be in the air and I'll have to go under the stage because he straight up won't turn around in the air and so the only way to get the tether to connect is underneath the stage. and sometimes as K-rool I won't be able to land mid air neutral B's",SmashBrosUltimate
What are some REALISTIC character predictions for the remaining DLC fighters?,"By realistic, I mean characters who you think have a good chance of making it in rather than characters you want to get in. 

Some things you may or may not want to consider when narrowing down your prediction list:

1. The character has to justify getting a stage to go along with them.

With Smash 4, only the characters from franchises previously unrepresented in smash, such as Ryu and Cloud, had a stage to go along with them. With Smash Ultimates DLC, we know that all the characters being added will have a stage bundled along with them. This could possibly mean that the remaining DLC fighters will all be from new franchises, and considering the fact that there aren't many Nintendo franchises not already represented in smash (through spirit, assist trophy, music or fighter), this could mean that the remaining fighters are all from third-party franchises.

2. There haven't been any third-party fighters from western developers yet.

This rule probably won't hold up over time, but I felt it was worth mentioning anyway since we're trying to narrow the possible characters down as much as possible. So far there haven't been any third-party fighters from developers such as Ubisoft, Bethesda, or any other western developers. I feel like Rayman had the best shot of being a fighter, but then he got added in as a trophy in Smash 4 and a spirit in Smash Ultimate.

3. Sakurai adds whoever he wants to the game

So far, the only confirmed requirement for being in Smash is that the character has to have originated from a video game. Other than that, there can many reasons a character can get into smash. Some characters such as King K. Rool and Ridley have been added in because of popularity, while other characters such as Piranha Plant have been added in because Sakurai thinks they would work well as a fighter. It's also worth mentioning that Snake was added in Brawl because Kojima asked Sakurai to add him in, and Joker was added in Ultimate because Sakurai was just a fan of Persona 5. 

4. Developers are under an NDA after agreeing to have their character in smash.

After the developers sign the NDA to have their fighter added to the game, they won't be allowed to talk about it afterward to the public. So developers who've recently gone out of their way to mention that they want their character in smash probably haven't signed an NDA yet.

5. It's not confirmed whether or not spirits de-confirm fighters.

If you want to narrow your prediction list down even further, you could exclude characters who are already in the game as spirits. So far though, there's been nothing to say whether or not spirits can be added in later as fighters.

6. Vergeben's leaks haven't been disproven yet

According to Vergeben, &gt;!Erdrick from Dragon Quest !&lt; is the next DLC fighter. So far, Vergeben's Smash leaks haven't been proven wrong yet, and some other sources are apparently saying that &gt;!Erdrick !&lt; is the next DLC fighter too, so you could add them to the prediction list if you want. He's also saying that &gt;!Minecraft content!&lt; is being added to the game too, although he isn't sure if &gt;!Steve !&lt; is a fighter. None of this has been officially confirmed though, so you could just ignore all of this you don't believe the leaks.",SmashBrosUltimate
Pokemon Trainer Idea,"I had a random idea for Pokemon Trainer that honestly I think would make the character a lot more interesting. 

It wouldn't work in practice and only in theory.

I was thinking, what if the 3 Pokemon we're their own stock? Like once one ""fainted"" or whatever you were forced to use the other Pokemon for the match. However you could swap out the Pokemon but the Pokemon retained their own percentages.

So if you started with Squirtle and took like 60% you could swap to Ivysaur with 0%. However, if say your playing ivysaur and get hit to like 120% and switch back to Squirtle you'd be put back at 60%. 

 But if Squirtle gets KO'd then you'd be forced to use the Ivysaur at 120% and Charizard and unable to use Squirtle. This really only works in paper and if matches we're only 3 stock but I still like the idea of it.",SmashBrosUltimate

Special Zoom and Final Zoom - an explanation,"So I saw a thread on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SmashBrosUltimate/comments/bkqwhr/yeet/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) and just wanted to talk about the fact that there’s two versions of the Zoom in effect - special Zoom and Finish/Final Zoom (names pulled from [the wiki](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Special_Zoom))

Basically, Special Zoom is for moves that are usually hard to hit, or special in some way - examples being falcon punch and all of clouds limit break moves. This is the blue effect

Final Zoom happens on moves that will kill with no DI (or extremely close - not actually sure how this one works), and is the red effect. It also only happens on Final stock.

As for why I knew this, I got caught in a wiki rabbithole a few months ago and basically learned about like 60+ different smash terms and interactions",SmashBrosUltimate
SHEIK COMBOS AND KILL CONFIRMS + DRAG DOWN LOOPS COMBOS MIGHT MAKE SHEIK VIABLE AGAIN (testing),"Hello everyone, I am as new as can be to this subreddit and would like to share some info with you about sheik, a character that was once fun and that people loved to play as. Sheik has been buffed from the last game but not as much as everyone else. Something was off, her combos connecting were even feeling wonky. Her whole play style felt very stringy and damage output is garbage. There had to be a reason besides engine changes.

So I wasted lots of time labbing out sheik for around maybe 100+ hours, nothing too crazy but i think i found a solution to her lack of kill power. Lemme just say first, her kill setups are incredibly hard and only work at certain percents. Second, these combos were not all tested on actual people but were instead tested on the combo meter in training mode, it is one of the reasons I decided to post here about sheik. Third, sheik's damage output is really bad and she needs lots of optimization and it will take A LOT of practice for her to be usable even in quickplay.

I AM STILL TRYING OUT THINGS WITH SHEIK, A LOT OF MY TESTING WITH HER IS A WIP. HER LOOPS COMBO SECTION POST WILL BE DONE SHORTLY

When I first started playing sheik in ultimate, my gsp decreased to around 20k, and after extensive testing and practice, I have managed to bring it up to 4 million, still trying for elite with her but her damage is just so bad.

Like I said, my biggest issue was killing. I just started edge gaurding with bouncing fish to be honest, I had to play offstage like my life depended on it. If i managed to take someone's jump I would just end up downBing them and take an easy stock. Also use upsmash as an anti-air if your opponent is jumping over u a lot (we all have that one friend who crosses up with aerials). This whole paragraph is just telling you to play more aggressive offstage, and to look for openings your opponent gives you that you may be able to take advantage of with sheiks amazing frame data.

ANYWAYS, HERE ARE THE COMBOS YOU GUYS ARE HERE TO SEE

(all these combos were tested on meta knight as well, i wanted to account for characters with circular hurtboxes but tried to look for a character with close-to-mid-tier-weight too)

Porky/Pokey Minch DLC prediction,"You should probably not read this if you plan on playing Earthbound and/or Mother 3 spoiler free

(You can skip this for moves prediction) Porky/Pokey has had some form of representation in most smash games so it's very odd that there is a lack of Porky in Ultimate. He was a boss in brawl and has his own stage. Every other boss from brawl has returned as a spirit/boss and even the Absolutely Safe Capsule spirit uses the sprite without Porky in it. This can't be brushed off as ""we forgot"" since the 3 mother games got great spirit representation and Porky is far to important to just forget.

To top it all off its Mother's 30th Anniversary and it would be great to see a Mother series rep with Earthbound (and hopefully Mother 3) coming to Switch.

He has the potential to be a very unique character so here's some moves I think could be cool

Special Moves

Monotoli's Helicopter (Up B) - has a limited amount of fuel that automatically recharges while you aren't using it and you can leave it whenever you want. When it runs out you will fall out and the helicopter will crash with an explosion.

Bomb (Neutral B) - Throw a bomb. The longer you hold B the farther you will throw the bomb but hold it too long and it will explode in your hand.

Spider Mech (Side B) - Enter Porky's spider mech and ram into the opponent.

PSI Shield Device (Down B) - Reflects energy and small bomb type projectiles (like Magnet)

Spider Mech 2 (Final Smash) - Use Porky's Mother 3 spider mech to go to the top of the screen and fire a massive laser that can be controlled (similar to Lucario)

Taunts 

Spankety Spankety Spankety!

Sticking out his tongue (like how he does in the Absolutely Safe Capsule)

Defeat/Win Screen

A few Pigmasks praising King P while a short version of the Pigmask theme plays.

Just the Absolutely Safe Capsule or no one standing there 

Alternate Skins:

The Black and Red Suit 
Pigmask 
Picky
King P Statue
Old Porky 
Green Skin
Porky 01 is mechanically an alternate skin

He quickly figured out that his recovery was complete ass and i suggested that he try other characters cause little mac was so exploitable, but he persisted with ONLY little mac. We would beat each other pretty evenly at first, but i got too used to his habits and i kept gimping him every time i threw him offstage, so now he just rages all the time when i destroy his little mac LMAO after many self-destructs and ridiculous  gimp-deaths at 0% he finally decided to try another character. However, because he had conditioned himself to only stay on the ground and not use ANY arial moves so he was back to square one if he didnt play little mac so now he rages even more and just plays little mac to stand a chance trolololol XD so moral of the story, dont let your friends main little mac, i have to hold back so much now if my friend does not play little mac so that i can at least play the game with him",SmashBrosUltimate

I need help with a freind whos new to the game.,"So yesterday my friend bought a switch and smash to play with me and a few other people. I tried to teach him all the mechanics of the game i could, and while he did pick up the basic ones like shielding and tilts, he keeps getting upset because he ""never wins"" (despite winning multiple times against me and other people in an arena). I really want him to enjoy the game but it got to the point where him not having fun was affecting my attitude aswell, so i was wondering if anyone could help me come up with ideas to show him that he will get better with time and that he wont necessarily see instant progress (when i tried telling him this he just dismissed it and said ""im already the best ill ever be at this game"").",SmashBrosUltimate

NO! I'm talking the countdown taking up to 9 seconds to complete, going as low as 1 frame per 1.5 seconds. It was total garbage.

"After playing SFV, this game is MUCH less salty.","Don't upvote, just wanted any passerbys to be happy you didn't play SFV before if you didn't before. And if you did play SFV, you should relate.


In SFV, basically the top tier characters just DOMINATE, they keep you trapped in a corner with plus frames and then they have cancelable moves where they can cancel mid way and regain their plus frames in your face (Akuma's demon flip, M Bison's devil reverse for example) and all these plus frames also means you have to play an extremely solid defense with barely any turns taken for you. You'd have to taken a risk like catch microwalk frames or get potentially frame trapped and counter hit  or waste your V-Trigger yourself.

Last thing is V-Trigger themselves are sooooooo skilless. Basically the more you get hit, the more meter build to gain your V-Trigger, there's characters with V-Triggers so strong that when you attack the opponent using those characters (R Mika / Ibuki), THEY LIKE IT, because when they get the V-Trigger, they can get like potentially 2 resets to end the game.

When I die on Smash brothers ultimate, I feel like... Hey you actually did outplay me no matter which character, every game is fun even when I lose. On SFV, even winning is not fun. I love the movement and freedom of styles you can play even with only a few special movies, and the classic blocking and dodging system, somehow they pull it off! (I play sonic). I just wanted to vent and I'm happy I bought a Switch &amp; SBU.

Disclaimer: I'm not even the people that hate SFV, I actually try to stay positive about the game but it really is salt inducing and skilless where most of the damage is taken. (Plat on SFV)",SmashBrosUltimate

You should not lose GSP for losing to player who doesn't have your rules,"you might think this is dumb cuz it's probably going to be exploitable but hear me out

We all agree that fighting in a 3 minutes match or items or in omega form against a projctile character is just not fun...

any player who has brain and expierence will go for 3 stock 7 minutes and a battlefield ( platforms ) 

it's so frustrating losing to a guy who has hazards on ( it says that it's hazards off but you're actually fightning the map not the player, it's retarded. and hazards are on don't trust the game)

this is how the system should work.

&amp;#x200B;

You are going to lose points if the enemy had similar rulesets to yours. for example

 : you had platform 7 minutes 3 stock but the enemy had platforms 3 stock and 6 minutes (counts)

you had platform 7 minutes 3 stock but the enemy had platform 3 stock and 3 minutes ( doesn't count )

3.0.0 Update - Fix the Ice Climbers AI (Nana),"I'm not quite sure if this subreddit is the right place to discuss this sort of thing nor if this topic has already been discussed, but here goes:

All I'm asking in this post is for the AI (Nana that is, not Popo) in the Ice Climbers to be fixed. Granted, no AI is nor never will be ""perfect"", but at least improve Nana's ""reflexes"". What I mean is, as an Icies main, it is really frustrating for Nana to periodically airdodge away from Popo or grab the ledge and not fast fall towards Popo when the latter is in dire need of Nana for a stock-saving Up-B or Side-B. To be more specific, whenever I (both Icies) get knocked away from the stage and make my way back in a diagonal fashion (from further up-left to down-right, for exemple) and do so so as to not be too predictable getting back to the stage, Nana has a tendency to grab the ledge but leave Popo in a freefall, even if I used one jump beforehand to try and get back up. Nana ends up just hanging there (doesn't fast-fall to get closer to Popo) while Popo can't do an Up-B. I hope this exemple wasn't too complicated in illustrating my point.

I'd say about half of my deaths are due to dumb Nana moves made by the AI such as this one. You could argue that I should ""adapt my style of playing"" and instead focus on getting as close to Nana as possible with Popo without yet attempting to grab the ledge. While a valid point, this forces me to have instead a *more predictable playstyle* with Icies, just because of a faulty AI. Other characters have many, more *consistent* options for recovery (they don't rely on half of the character which you can't fully control) or one main recovery move that is *mostly safe to use* (ie: K Rool's Up-B).

Personally, I feel as though the AI for Nana is what is holding back the character from being *at least* high-midtier. They don't need a buff in damage (as the pair already do a ton), faster moves (they weren't designed to be particularly fast hitters),  or reduced knockback when hit (they were designed to be still fragile). I am not a pro Icies player, nor am I really that skilled with them, I just feel as though the AI is making my gameplay experience with this fun character a lot more frustrating and ""unfun"" than it should be. Thanks for reading my (long) post/rant. Please leave comments suggesting any good changes I should make to my Icies playstyle, or any points I may have missed.

Two 2.0.2 glitches that I found.,"I've found a third one, but it's hard to pull off on a specific part of a stage. I couldn't recreate it. Use Kirby or King Dedede (not tested King K. Rool) and anybody else. The Paper Mario stage. It's like right before the whale comes up. Kirby or King Dedede (maybe King K. Rool) tosses a Smart Bomb down at another player (Explosions like this don't harm you anymore). and just be VERY lucky that you toss it right before the whale comes up and you get the time to Inhale them in the explosion of the Smart Bomb. If done right, the player Kirby and yes the other suckers, again sucked up should be clipped through the stage. I don't think they can get back up. I did this to a Sonic who tried to recover and went through the stage all the way down to the blast zone. And yeah, a WARNING. Just remember that the Smart Bomb can be a prankster and mess up the whole part by not working. So it's an EXTREME luck glitch. It's not just at a specific stage as a glitch. We can find more with Kirby, King Dedede and King K. Rool's sucking neutral specials through Smart Bomb glitching. Yes, tell me what you find if you're willing to help us find more glitches.

And a fourth one but I don't remember how it was done. I have no replay, sadly. Pokemon Trainer switched Pokemon at maybe a frame perfect timing once their Final Smash Meter hit 100% and they had no Final Smash aura. They switched into Charizard. And Pokemon Trainer was the only one with a Final Smash ready. I think the others lost or used their Final Smash and THEN the aura disappeared. I'm very confused about this one, since I don't know if it's a glitch or not. So see if you guys can find how this was pulled off. Anyways, onto these!

[Upcoming] Smash League: A competitive Super Smash Ultimate league.,"Hello! It's my first post on this sub.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a developer, who over the past few weeks, have been developing a way to play with people that are more your skill level. Now I'm going to be honest with you. I have \*no\* clue how smash works, nor have I played it. My friend Brian who plays it often has been describing the game and how it works to me, but if I get anything wrong, tell me.

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_How to play\_\_:

\- Join the Discord Server \[TBA\]

\- Use the bot to create an account

\- Customize your account with a username and your \*\*GSP\*\* (Global Smash Power) which automatically increases based on the highest user.

\- After that, you are all set to queue! How the queue system works will be described below.

\- Once you get into a match by using the \`!q\` (queue) command, the bot will send a DM to you and the person you queued with.

\- One person creates the match, while another joins it. Then, you fight.

\- The winner of the match then returns to discord, and types \`!report &lt;match id included in the DM&gt; win\`. This will update the statistics for each player in the match. (These results can be disputed if they are reported by the loser).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_The Ranking System\_\_:

\- There are 4 divisions that will \*most likely\* receive a name change. They are as follows.

Lowest. This is the lowest queue, which has a minimum requirement of 1,000,000 GSP to get in.

Low. This is the beginning of the dynamic rankings. The current minimum is 2,000,000, but this will change according to the players that sign up.

Mid. This is the middle queue, which \*currently\* has a minimum of 3,000,000. 

Top. Last but not least, the top division. Currently with a minimum of 4,000,000, this is the rank for the most elite of players.

\- Each player also has their own \*\*MMR\*\* (Match Making Rating) which can tell the other person how well they have been performing in their match history.

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_Stats\_\_:

\- Each player has stats that everyone can view, which mainly right now is \`GSP, MMR\` and \`winrate\`.

&amp;#x200B;

The estimated release date for this has not been decided, but I will update those interested when I come nearer to finishing up the bot. Thanks for reading, and I look forward to seeing you all in the coming weeks.

I need help as a new Pokemon trainer main,"So, I'm a new pt main, and I want to know more about the character. Here are the things I want to know/have trouble with:

1. What are some combos for each of the 3? (Mostly looking for squirtle and ivysaur tho. Charizard could help, but I use him to try and kill)

2. I can't seem to kill. I get my opponents to high percantage the best I can, but I can't seem to kill (looking to see kill moves i.e up smash, up tilt and stuff like that, as well as which character kills with said moves)

3. If you were to go very low (near bottom blast zone perhaps), how can you recover? I find myself dying a lot because I can't recover that well as pt (I don't go that low, but I still can't make it back. Usually happens when I'm squirtle, but a lot as ivy as well)

4. Who is the best character to edge guard?

5. When on the ledge being edge guarded, how should I go about getting back on stage, and with which character?

Is there a competitive ultimate subreddit ?,"**----------------------------------- RANT -----------------------------------**

I just realized that this subreddit was almost bad and unintelligent players mostly. (mea culpa, should've realized sooner when the only posts that get upvoted are memes and that the only advices given to players that try to get better by asking questions are ""git gud"")

&amp;#x200B;

When you say something, the only answer you get is ""you're bad at the game"" ""git gud"" and all the generic answers.

&amp;#x200B;

People  in this subreddit don't understand anything and just downvote relevant posts without managing to discuss and assert anything with good constructed arguments and logic.

&amp;#x200B;

They don't understand that, as you get better, your opponents get better, and thus, that each player complaining about a common issue they are having aren't necessarily the same level.

&amp;#x200B;

They don't understand that annoying strategies such as camping and spamming don't disappear when reaching a higher level, but contrariwise, they just get honed.

&amp;#x200B;

In this subreddit, elite smash is irrelevant because why would it be if they can't reach it using a fair ruleset (can't reach it using an unfair one either anyway) ?

btw yes, elite smash is relevant because unlike in arenas, it will match you (not most of the time, but more often than in arenas) against players your level.

And don't even dare trying to make a constructed answer in this subreddit.

Fuck online,"It really bugs me that smash ultimate is a near perfect smash game, but it has one glaring issue; the online. The online just sucks, a real shame considering how it's suppose to be the mode that prolongs the game's lifespan. The lag is still a big issue, even with a router; the damn matches play like a google slides presentation. (which conveniently happens when it's last stock and you have the lead) The preferred rule set's are still an issue; not so much for elite smash but for your other characters on the roster who has low gsp and you end up in a one stock with hazards and item's on. The general playstyle of people online is just; boring. Everyone is comfortable with spamming and you react accordingly and they STILL spam. It gets ridiculous when a young link or Belmont just refuses to do anything else but press b. Elite Smash and Gsp is just a joke, let's be honest we're all memeing on the damn thing constantly and for good reason too lol. You got people like Quak getting characters he's never played before into elite smash in 10 minutes; like seriously? This is what we are paying 20 dollars for? The input delay online is fucking wild, good luck trying to punish or land a combo with your tilts when your inputs are as slow as shit coming from a hippos asshole. (it's an exaggeration of course, but it's BAD at times) Sometimes you get match with someone with like 4.5 mill gsp while you have half of that, thanks game. You can't switch characters on a rematch; like who thought it was a good idea to take that feature out from ultimate? The hit boxes on some characters are just dumb. Ivysaur dair and uair, ganons fsmash, ike in general, WOLF. I love getting hit a mile away. Overall I think you guy's get my point, this game could be the best smash ever if it just fixed these damn issues, and before you say ""you're just bad at the game"" i'm in elite smash with Incineroar, Zelda, Bowser, and Isabelle, not like it matters; but still.

THIS is KILLING the GAME (no clickbait!!!),"Sup y'all

I don't know if this is an opinion shared by the wider community but I am going to rant about this anyway. I watched highlights of [Battle of BC3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtBRsFkA8u4) and much like other tournament highlight videos I was left with a sour taste in my mouth seeing people get KOed by Pikachu and Peach's fucking DASH ATTACKS.

&amp;#x200B;

Similar in a sense to the complaint re Jigglypuff in Melee, Ultimate is a really flashy game, with a lot of sweet combos coming out. Esam plays Pikachu so well, and he pulls off some killer combos and amazing thunder plays, but if they don't work, all he needs to do is dash attack to kill at 120%. Peach is, as well, a top tier character that is played by Zack and plenty of others at high level play, and like Pikachu, has an incredible plethora of kill moves. But again, if you for some reason can't get in and kill with ANY of her aerials, you can just dash attack and kill on stage at percentages LOTS of characters struggle to kill at.

&amp;#x200B;

I know dash attack on virtually all characters (Snake, Wolf as some exceptions) is a very unsafe move that can be punished easily off of shield, but should dash attack, from any non heavyweight character, ever actually kill at reasonable percentages? I'm tired of seeing a close game get to the last stock, both players at 100% damage, and someone just wins with dash attack. Not only because it's boring but because fundamentally I don't believe any dash attack should kill so soon. Especially from this anorexic rat with kill moves in every other aspect of the game, and especially from a magic Princess (or her tomboy cousin) who can kill with 9/10 of the rest of her kit.  


KIM I'm not mad at these players for using the characters strengths to their advantage, I am however, mad at SAKURAI(!!!) in that these are strengths in the first place. Also this does not apply to just Pikachu and Peach, but also any non-heavy that kills off dash attack. Tell me why I am wrong in the section below.",SmashBrosUltimate

Greninja main - need help with certain MUs,"Hi all! 

I seem to have a hard time against the following characters (note: they are usually running the battle arenas - not spammy and are legit good):

- ROB
- Villager
- Robin
- Pikachu / Pichu

ROB has ultra aggressive moves I think. Both of our aerials have lag, but his has farther reach. I do get caught off guard by the gyro and laser more than I’d like. And his OOS option of doing the spinning thing (not the b special move) or getting dthrow catches me if I attack shield. 

Villager’s campy playstyle can be tough for me (as I like to bait and punish). A Villager who keeps the same strategy without losing composure is tough for me. The Fair is quicker, stronger and has further reach than my shuriken - when I’m patient, I’ll up my win rate but not always the case. 

I probably don’t know Robins moves enough, but his own PK fire is legit and his aerials seem to cover good distance. Perhaps I just need more experience against this character (or play as him/her) - but it’s been tough. 

Pikachu/Pichu are just tough - the thunder jolt thing is ok (as I’ll do substitute from time to time - or just jump), but I’ll lose in the aerial match up. I’ve gotten spiked a couple times when we’re both recovering - likely need to practice manuevering the up b a bit so it’s not always a straight line. 

Let me know your thoughts. Thanks!",SmashBrosUltimate

The main thing I cannot stand about this game is it has no combo trials mode like almost every other fighting game,"The game teaches you nothing other than the basics which are in like a 20 second video. Where’s the trials mode which shows characters combos? 

It doesn’t teach you how to do anything advanced in the game which is why you get so many matches where people just go crazy online and press buttons constantly. I’m one of them people. I have no idea what to punish with for the characters I use and what there combos are. 9 times out of 10 I will either throw or just mash A. ",SmashBrosUltimate

Do you think we'll get a true western character as Smash DLC?,"If so, would you want one?

(P.S. Diddy, K. Rool, and Dark Samus do not count. They were western-created, but they are still made for and owned by a Japanese IP.)",SmashBrosUltimate
Ness and his awful PK Fire which drives me crazy,"So I've been playing with Bowser against a friend who mains Ness. We've been doing a lot of 1vs1 (on Battlefield) and what I noticed is that he has been spamming ""PK Fire"" a lot.

His main tactic was basically:
- always staying at the bottom of the stage so I couldn't get below them
- whenever I was coming from the side, spam the PK Fire: Bowser would get stuck and he could use his Side-Smash

In my opinion Ness is a bit too OP. He can simply spam PK Fire and I don't see any way of freeing yourself once you're stuck in it, so...

How can you defend yourself against PK Fire? Or more in general: What's the best way against this sort of tactic described above?

I appreciate any kind of tips you will give me! :)",SmashBrosUltimate

"Feel like hitting a wall in my progression, any advise?","Hello guys, I'm actually stuck in GSP hell, I'm training fairly regularly recently but I still feel like I suck a\*\* at this game and see no real improvement.

I don't have many options to play serious 1V1 locally so I stick with online play but my win rate is laughable.

I understand the basics of short hop, tech, spacing etc... but can't seem to pull them out in real situations.

I also often have hard time to keep my cool, I mean, after few wins I always end up destroyed 8 times in a row, which is so much frustrating.

I've uploaded a compilation of 4 matches I've done, here : [https://youtu.be/uACMQMm9jAo](https://youtu.be/uACMQMm9jAo) 

If some of you could watch and give me some insights I would be grateful.

1st fight, vs CLOUD (win) : I think I should have lost here, he missed his input for a recovery and gave me the 2nd stock, without this, he would have kept the lead and won.

2nd fight, vs Young LINK (win) : This one is interesting, he totaly bodied me the 1st half of the match, I think he became to confident, that's why he sacrifice KO'd me to secure the second stock. In the end, I thought I had nothing to loose and tried to go for the spike, that caught him of guard and it worked.

3rd fight, vs CHROM (lost) : Unlike the 2 earlier, I think I could have won, failed reverse b cost me the game, but still have hard time again swordmen.

4th fight, vs WOLF (lost) : This one is pretty even, but is boring to watch, I hate wolf blaster &gt;\_&lt;

Anyway, if you can tell me where are my worst flows this would be awesome, from what I see, I think short-hopping and spacing are what I have to work on first, tho i'm not sure how to use this well in a fight.

Last thing, I main Sonic but I feel his neutral game is pretty bad in this game, I have hard time to reach characters with high range like swordmen or zoners, if there are sonic mains out there any tips are welcome.

Thanks to all who took time to read this and who'll be willing to help.

Banjo and Kazooie have a greater chance than before in being in Smash Bros as DLC and here's why(Warning: very extensive),"1)All other potential Microsoft's reps have been deconfrimed. Cuphead, although he would have been a unique addition, his game was out when Smash Bros Ultimate was still in development. And he came a little bit too late for as the DLC fighters have already been settled on that point. Master Chief has been Deconfirmed to oblivion by one of the Halo game's developers in this tweet:
https://twitter.com/franklez/status/1076911083909132289?s=19
As for Minecraft Steve, as memetastic that would be, I'm pretty sure nobody really unironically sees Steve having a feecable spot in the Smash bros roster. The best for Steve to have is an assist trophy at best.

Many people point to tweets and comments made by the developers saying they'd be happy if their characters would be in Smash Bros as proof these characters will indeed be in Smash.  But the thing is, what game developer WOULDN'T want their character in Smash? One might make my argument backfire by applying this to Banjo Kazooie and Phil Spencer's tweets. But I do believe Banjo and Kazooie can be exempt. Which leads me to Reason 2

2) Nintendo and Microsoft's new found bromance. If you're not in the know, Nintendo and Microsoft has settled their differences, and started cooperating with each other as of late. This is evident with them allowing Minecraft and Cuphead on the Switch. What is making things more crazy, is that reports came out that suggest Microsoft is planning to port Xbox Live and the Xbox Game Pass over to the Switch, and port other Xbox exclusives to the Switch. Not only would that mean Banjo Kazooie will be playable once more in a Nintendo device(So Hip Hip Hooray! for the Banjo Kazooie fandom), but that also increases Banjo and Kazooie's Chances at being in Smash Brothers.


3) A common trend in Smash is that each game includes a new character from Nintendo's past. In Melee we got the likes of Ice Climbers and Mr.Gaming Watch. In Brawl we got R.O.B the robot. In the Smash Bros For the Wii U and the 3DS port we got Duck Hunt and Little Mac. And for Ultimate, we got my boy King K Rool and Ridley. Wouldn't the logical thing for Ultimate DLC to follow suit with perhaps including a certain Bear and Bird from the N64 variety? Its certainly possible. 

Thats all I have really.",SmashBrosUltimate

Need help against DK and KRool.,"(sorry if this doesnt belong here, ill put it in the megathread otherwise)

As the title says, how do I beat DK and KRool? I main Bayo and Roy (and a bit of Zelda) all of them are around 3 million GSP.

Against DK, I always get fucked whenever he does some bullshit true grab combo, and when he’s in advantage he usally will grab me, run offstage, forward throw. Pretty much kills at 80%

Against KRool, I don’t really have trouble getting him up to high percentages, I only have trouble killing him because of his D-throw when I’m at 110%+ which he gets because of Crown + Cannon does like 30+ something.

The guy I play alot against mains these fuckers, and I wanna beat him due to an upcoming locals tournament.
