Time Trial issues,[removed],mariokart
Time Trial [MK8DX], So I have always considered myself very good at this game. When I play online I can come in 1st or near top every time. I can do each track without mistakes and drift very well. However when it comes to the time trials I just can't seem to beat the Nintendo ghost required for gold. I have even watched videos of all the top speed runner and seem to have issues. Anyone else have a lot of issues with this?,mariokart

I think I have discovered a new glitch in MK7 (I hope),"Well, I was just playing around, doing tracks like Wuhu Loop and Toad Circuit backwards when I maybe had discovered a new glitch, in an older version of the game because, I can't update it IDK why but, you have to do this 
1. Go to any track you could do backwards like Toad Circuit or Wuhu Loop
2. DO IT backwards
3. try to do it normally
4. Be confused because you can't do more laps
5. Hit yourself in your confusion
Yea, Laps will not count any more

[MK] Small Youtubers Who Deserve More Attention,"I'm new here, but I just wanted to come to Reddit since I know Reddit has a fairly large community, and I really want to help these small channels grow. All of these were chosen based off how good their content is, not how specifically small each channel is. Feel free to keep this going in the comemnts. So, here they are:
1. ArcIntel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnj1Pd85wIoH-cWGH7iN4eQ)
ArcIntel posts a variety of videos focusing on Mario Kart Wii, and that are very instructive. The videos are highly polished, and also very informative. Although larger than what many would usually consider as a small YouTuber, the effort put into these videos really deserves a lot more attention.

2. MKWilliam (www.youtube.com/channel/UCN8p3syeiTVrUz-9FTw-txw)
MKWilliam is a lot smaller than ArcIntel, with less than 100 subscribers. He uploads a lot of comparison videos, such as comparing the world records of the same track within different Mario Karts, but also uploads other things such as a top 5 glitches for Rosalina's Ice World in Mario Kart 7, as well as a Ghost Merge video, which was a really interesting concept, although kinda trippy to watch. He also uploaded a time trial world record evolution for Mushroom Cup, and has said that he will be uploading these for other cups as well. His content is mainly focused on Mario Kart 7, however due to some of the series that he does, anyone can likely find a video involving whichever game they play, and frequent uploads are also a plus

3. NH64 (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTCScSFZxdhSW1HkS4kfdaQ)
NH64 uploads a lot of the content that you would expect from a Mario kart YouTuber. However, he branches out from time to time to upload other things, such as analyzing world records, and their progression throughout the years. He is similar to ArcIntel in the fact that he also already has over 1000 subscribers. However, his content is very watchable, and his calm personality help to contribute to the overall positive tone his videos portray for mainly Mario kart wii

4. TaylorMK7 (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXTy-so_0oyUvvrvYLw1Y4w/videos?disable_polymer=1)
TaylorMK7 is a Mario Kart 7 player who is starting to rapidly grow his channel since the release of CTGP-7. He has been uploading a lot of variety with his content recently, and also has a capture card, which is something that most Mario Kart 7 players do not have, due to how expensive and hard to get 3DS capture cards are. He is a strong player, and definitely deserves more attention, as he has uploaded consistently for a long time.

5. AveryAlex (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxuyJEyhR0y3UF2JNqsoVGw)
AveryAlex is a YouTuber who uploads some games other than just Mario Kart, but mainly focused on Mario Kart Wii. His uploads are scarce, but the quality of the videos is always good, and is often either addressing an issue, or uploading content that you can find elsewhere, but is still good quality.

As I said at the top, please continue this by adding more in the comments. Mario Kart is a really hard game for people to grow from, and bringing attention to channels (especially someone like MKWilliam who doesn't even have 100 subscribers yet) can really help to motivate people, and boost their channels up to where they deserve to be.",mariokart

I was looking at the wired controller from PDP that has the audio input built in. I also see that if you want to do audio chat in mariokart 8 D you need to use the mobile phone app (at least I think you do). 

So does this mean that the PDP controller with the audio jack is not supported for MK8D?

And, are there only specific games you can use the PDP controller with (for Audio chat)?

After almost seven months of playing Crash Team Racing Nitro Fueled (CTR) it's made me realize just how awful the character select screen is in Mario Kart 8 and I feel underwhelmed every time I look at it. CTR has more than 50 characters as of right now and each character has their own unique skins with some skins getting their own animations. The worst part of Mario Kart's roster is the sheer amount of clones which could be handled like they are in CTR.

I've only included Mario characters on my list and if there's any character or skin you people would like to see let me know.

Now with all that said, I still enjoy Mario Kart more than CTR but because of CTR I want so much more from it.",mariokart

[MKWii] [MK7] [MK8] Hypothetical / Alternative Retro Track List,"I probably made a post similar to this and posted it to a forum somewhere a few years ago. I thought of doing this idea again and spent like two hours just thinking about this coming up with this.

Basically the point of this post is to fantasize what a more cohesive retro track selection would be for our beloved Mario Kart games. The biggest issue with the retro tracks situation is how Mario Kart Wii had the most boring retro track list, along with ""unevenly distributing"" retro tracks for previous games.

Also while I love the introduction of Retro tracks, I believe it was introduced a game too early. Feel free to disagree I personally think Mario Kart DS had enough to make it an enjoyable game with all the features it had. Besides, I also think it didn't do its retro tracks justice, especially the Gamecube ones. (But it's okay cause they were pretty boring tracks except Yoshi Circuit.)

Anyways, my alternate vision is they introduced Retro tracks in Mario Kart Wii.

https://preview.redd.it/29fdacjfp3941.jpg?width=716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c1e8193f99f28ef2741ff03489848fdea0bc47e

Retro Track Distribution

Wii: 4 SNES, 3 N64, 3 GBA, 3 GCN, 3 DS  
3DS: 2 SNES, 3 N64, 3 GBA, 2 GCN, 3 DS, 3 Wii  
MK8: 2 of each previous game +2 more N64 tracks  
(DLC is the same, +2 GBA, +2 GCN, +1 Wii, +1 3DS, ""+1"" SNES (even though it's reusing a previous retro track)

&amp;#x200B;

Total Tracks Used for Retro Tracks

SNES: 8/20 (same w/ DLC)  
N64: 10/16  
GBA: 8/20 (10/20 w/ DLC)  
GCN: 8/16 (10/16 w/ DLC)  
DS: 8/16  
Wii: 5/16 (6/16 w/ DLC)  
3DS: 2/16 (3/16 w/ DLC)

&amp;#x200B;

One thing to note, the ""distribution"" is not perfect, but it is very fair and makes for fun times. Besides, if it was ""perfectly distributed,"" then the selection would be boring. (no one wants to play another SNES Mario Circuit or GBA Bowser Castle)

Also, this list was heavily influenced by how the current Retro Track selections were chosen for each game, for the most part preserving MK8 list with a few changes. I can't confirm but I think this made it harder for me to select tracks because I don't want to stray/let go of what has already been done. It's also very hard to do so anyways.

Maybe someone can make a list completely different than this, who knows? I just hope this sparks some discussion/ideas within people.

[MK8DX] Mario Kart Tournament: Work Assignment,"Cheers everyone!! So, I have been delegated a job at work for our upcoming annual kick off meeting. We all go to an event center and eat dinner, drink beers, talk shop, and have games and other activities.

This year we’ve decided to hold a Mario Kart Tournament. There will be between 24-36 individuals participating with the winner of each round/race/etc. moving on to the next bracket. However, we only have about 1.5 hrs to hold for the tournament and select a winner (1 individual will get a prize with a 2nd place and 3rd place as well).

I want each bracket to have more difficult tracks than the last. If possible.

Questions: Which tracks should I include? How would you do the elimination? Single? Double? Should I do two switches at the same time? Should the last race be a Grand Prix? Any restriction on vehicles/wheels/etc.? How to make it simple even for people that don’t play very often? Should I convince my company to buy the steering wheels for the controllers? Questions I haven’t asked? Should we have four people per council and the 1st place or 1st and 2nd place winners move on (regardless of CPU placement)?

[MKX] My Hopes for Mario Kart 10.,[removed],mariokart
[MK] I hope this title works.,"You could argue MK8D is 8.5/9, and MKT is just testing grounds.  
  
I think MKX will do what Smash Ultimate did and be THE Mario Kart and merge all the previous games.    
  
MK has pretty much followed the same formula for the past 8.5 entires. MKT is the exception. It's the testing ground for a new mode. Improvisation. It's the same tracks that just get shuffled around randomly so you have constantly change your style. There's no memorizing the lines on the same maps anymore. Each one is different and requires a new line. Depending how this goes, it'll most likely be implemented in MKX. 

Here's my thoughts, or at least what I would want/expect.

Including new characters and maps, MKX will have...

Single Player:  
Every Course.  
Every Character.     
Every Item.  
Every Battle Mode.  
New Mission Mode.  
  
Multiplayer/Single Player:  
Doubles Mode. (Double Dash)     
Improvise Mode.  
  
You'll be able to select your rule set for each round more indepthly. Choose what items you want like in Smash turning them on and off.   
    
Custom Karts like how the DS mode let you draw your symbol but now you can paint certain models how you want and create your symbols again.   
   
A new point/reward system for item accuracy in battle mode. Sort of like an RPG but very very limited. You can upgrade items and make them more effective or unlock new abilities with them. This is limited to battle mode only and requires leveling up.

Online will have more tournament modes and weekly tours like we get on MKT. There will be separate reward systems from Grand Prix and the others.  
  
It'll basically be Super Mario Kart.",mariokart
[MKWii] Modding - Need help replacing sound files,"I've gotten into modding MKWii lately and I've been trying to replace the soundfiles from the original characters with ones from the new inserted characters. My problem is that BrawlBox doesn't seem to recognize the replacement of the soundfile as a change to the revo\_kart.brsar file... 

Here's what I'm doing:

Here's the sound file I wanna replace, it's Luigi's voice line when he gets a low placement.

[\\""Awww, Luigi lose! Mamaa- ha, ha, haaahh...\\""](https://preview.redd.it/180yxdu04ka41.png?width=540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92a6fe1401bcfa607c47d7cc684b4efb6ab4fda5)

Then I right click on the sound and select ""Replace""

After that I locate the soundfile I wanna replace it with and select it.

Now the file should be replaced. If I double-click on the sound entry to get a preview of the sound, it's been successfully replaced with the new voice line. All is as it should be. But when I hit Ctrl + S or select ""Save"" manually, this window pops up, saying that no changes were made.

When I close and reopen the revo\_kart file, it's back to Luigi's voice instead of the just replaced voice, it didn't get saved. What am I doing wrong?",mariokart

Are Dry Dry Desert and Dry Dry Ruins a throwback to Paper Mario? [MK],"By name at least, it seems to be the case. But there's no telling throwbacks to Paper Mario, like Tutankoopa and the Chain Chomps.

Notably, in Mario Kart: Super Circuit, Rainbow Road had a callback to Paper Mario. Bowser's Castle was floating in the background. Yet, that was the only title made by Intelligent Systems for the Mario Kart series. I'm not sure that's the case with the Dry Dry stages.",mariokart

FRUSTRATION PROJECTION [MK8DX],"I finally hopped back into MK8DX's online multiplayer after almost a year! I forgot how fun this game was, and how annoying red shells can be...

But, here's my problem.

do you guys find it tricky to place in the top 3 or 4 every race? I feel like I can stay pretty consistent for the first two laps (2nd or 3rd), but then I just get annihilated by triple reds or something and drop down to 5th or 6th.

[MK8D] How to Dodge the Blue Shell with Unconventional Theories,"For anyone Googling.

There are many ways on how to dodge a dreaded Blue Shell. One ""pro-gamer"" move is to take advantage of invincibility frames. For example, a similar method can be done by driving off the course, or bailing, like Abdallah and others have mentioned (link below)   
  
Abdallah's ""10 Ways To Dodge A Blue Shell In Mario Kart 8 Deluxe!""  
https://youtu.be/TNOnz0whcaQ . 
  
Although, it's not technically the ""invincibility frames"" it still works the same. Whenever you get hit by an item the game gives you a couple frames so other items can't affect you like with a spammed triple red shell strike. YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO SPAM YOUR TRIPLE RED SHELLS. Give them about 1.5 seconds in between so as soon as your target comes out of invincibility he gets hit again.   
  
A Blue Shell dodging technique not really touched on is the Banana Method. You trigger the invincibility frames at the right time by running over a Banana before the Blue Shell hits you. The Bananas takes less time to recover from. You can either run over one that's placed by another player, or throw your own Banana forward and run it over yourself.     
  
A Green Shell can do it too if you have the opportunity, aim, and luck to bounce it back at yourself off a wall or in a drift.   
   
A Lightning Bolt can trigger the invincibility frames too. This might be exploitable! To Call Thor you will need another person. Your friend is Thor. He stays in the bottom ranks purposefully hitting item boxes until he gets a Lightning Bolt. When you are in first and about to get hit by the Blue Shell tell your friend. Thor arrives in Wakanda and saves the place; your first place.    
   
It's still a Theory but when playing 2 player online player 2's points don't affect yours. You could essentially ""power level"" a friend. Someone could even offer a service online that joins your match and protects you from the rear.      
  
There's a few more ways but I'm tired, will update one day.",mariokart
[MK] Comparisons to Smash Bros,I like to compare Mario Kart to the Smash series just because of how similar their developments are and how similar they are in terms of features compared to other games in their series. Mario Kart Wii is the Smash Melee of Mario Kart due to the difficulty and never ending glitches. Mario Kart 7 is the Smash Brawl of Mario Kart due to the updated graphics and new takes in the series by adding new and cool features. Mario Kart 8 is the Smash 4 if Mario Kart due to the unpolished and unfinished feel. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the Smash Ultimate of Mario Kart due to all of the features and finally polishing and fixing the unfinished feel just mentioned. And of course Mario Kart 64 is the Smash 64 of Mario Kart due to being the game's debut and astonishing the world with a fresh new take on the genre.

Doesn't matter what I do, the game will fuck me over in the last couple of corners on every race. Here, have 6 shields hitting you. Here, have some bananas after we fucked you to 12th. Here have some coins will the rest of the field is blasting past you with bullets and stars. Got hit by lightning? Well we'll make sure to fuck you some more by juuust sliding you off the track or right into the path of a banana. And those fucking green shields. I can make a totally fucked up corner, end up way off track and magically I'll still get hit by one just because. Fucking things home in no matter where you drive.

What would make the best track?,[removed],mariokart
[MK] What would make your perfect Mario kart track?,"What would make the best track?

So basically, in my opinion a track like mount warmup, wuhu loop, big blue which doesn’t lap. Lap I: a huge jungle with tons of awesome jumps, turns, driving on mud, trees with streams and stuff. Lap II, your in a river going down a hill into a huge cave, with tons of shining ores, awesome streams, turns, Ramps and a huge cave village. Lap III you drop out of the cave and are on a... take a guess:


Medieval farm town! You drive through the animal farms, drift around the vegetable/plant ones, drive through the village and past the church, where you fall off a mountain ((flying is non existant here)) where you gotta avoid tons of lava blocks or you stick to it for three seconds, when you reach the bottom, you do a three second drive through a very tiny field.

Soft Drifting [MK8DX],"Hey guys, so I was researching on how soft drifting works and wether it makes a difference. The only proper video I found to explain was [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G8wi-PfJjU&amp;t=307s), but as I just noticed it is made on MK8 (WiiU).

Since there were quite some mechanical changes from MK8 to MK8DX, like the removal of Rapidfire Hopping, I was wondering wether soft drifting is still existent in MK8DX?

I've been trying to make it work by holding the stick outward from the direction I am drifting in, while angling it upwards diagonally (I was going for the typical 45 degrees). The problem I am having is that I can't feel a difference. This may be because MK is a hectic game and I wasn't able to compare the timing when lacking a side by side comparison,. Other toughts I had were that I was simply doing it wrong or that it is straight up removed in MK8DX.

Do you guys have more information on soft drifting, its effectiveness or on how to do it properly?

I'd be glad about any input you can give me!

[Mario Kart Wii] is a great game built on awful game design.,"I never usually talk about it, mainly because the really passionate fans do all the talking for me, but I genuinely like Mario Kart Wii. It may not be my favourite game in the series, but it is a pretty solid title that provides some sheer fun. And recently a thought occurred to me on why I find it so appealing, as potentially all its fans do: it breaks the rules of how to design a good game.

**Mario Kart Wii has no right to be as good as it is when in theory all of its core ideas are complete trash.**

**On its own, the track design is garbage with it being built around the gimmick of tricks and stunt driving. The physics are wack, and the stats only serve to make the entire experience strangely compromising and grueling. On top of this, you have the item balance being so over-the-top chaotic for the most part that it borders on sheer frustration, especially when you go for the tough unlockables. And yet, it all works. The game is legitimately great because all of these awful aspects come together into a chaotic but beautiful final product.**

In other words, a lot of the appeal for MKWii comes from how bad everything in the game is. This is not a case of “so bad it’s good” but rather “two negatives make a positive”. These severely flawed aspects would be largely unacceptable in any other Mario Kart game, but here where all the right elements are utterly incompetent (possibly intentionally) it is fun.

Take the track design. It is bad. Yes, you can applaud them for making it possible to race in a mall or on a tree. But the actual layout of the track is terrible. Just take a look at how the road is levelled and how many blind turns you need to take, especially on Rainbow Road where the ground is completely deformed. Now if the designs of these tracks are so bad, why would I call the Wii iterations of Bowser’s Castle and Rainbow Road among my favourites of the series? Because only in the self-contained world of MKWii can something like Rainbow Road be fun the way it is. Compare the track design here to MKDD, a game with a similar engine. Yes, you can easily port tracks from MKDD into MKWii without any major changes; just look at retro tracks like Waluigi Stadium or DK Mountain. But what if you ported Koopa Cape or Wario’s Gold Mine into MKDD? MKDD’s more refined driving mechanics, which also give way to fewer glitches overall, would not be suitable for driving on such tracks. This is also why porting Wii tracks is so complicated. MK7 onwards toned down the physics so much that doing any crazy stunts on the level of MKWii would require a significant overhaul in track design--which is exactly what happened when the tracks were ported.

**If anything, the gruelling chaos that MKWii brings because of how poorly designed these elements are is exactly what makes it so charming and what keeps people engaged.**

What do you all think of this? I could elaborate on this further in the comments if needed.",mariokart

Tracks are amazing, online is as good as Mario Kart Wii. The controls are some of the best in the series, battle mode is the best in the series and mission mode is one of the best modes in any Mario Kart game. 
Also, it’s in my opinion (this is a very controversial opinion) the most competitive game in the series. The tracks feel like they’re made for competitive play, the item RNG is usually fair, and there’s many techniques you can use to win in a competitive setting such as Snaking (I know snaking is a very controversial exploit with firehopping but I think it makes competi play more fun). So how come Mario Kart Wii has such a large audience whereas DS became more of a game with a smaller niche audience?",mariokart

[MKWII] [MK7] Mario kart 7 ruined Koopa cape,"So let me get through why I think Mario kart 7 ruined koopa cape and you can add on to what I said or give your opinion below. 
So basically Mario kart WII version had a good amount of goombas, 7 has too many. There’s a flying version at 7 which ruins the entire stream section imo and in Wii there weren’t and you got to go on the stream much more. Then in the underwater section there’s no spinning lightning things to avoid and you don’t get to drive on water, you use the under water mechanic which is way more boring and unrealistic. Anyway, share your thoughts below. c:",mariokart
[MKT] Mario Kart Tour is a joke,"Now I'm ready for the downvotes, but keep in mind folks ***this is my personal opinion*** on why I'm sad that Nintendo wasted a huge opportunity.

So,  Mario Kart Tour has a rapidly increasing amount of characters, which are someone difficult to get if you don't have the Gold Pass, which is incredibly expensive for a mobile game, and if you don't get it, you have to get ridiculously lucky in the pipes to get a solid amount of characters, now if these were like other Mario Kart games, with Lightweights, Heavyweights, etc. It would be just fine! Though, to make people want to get the other characters they had to mess with item boxes. 

I quite frankly don't understand why Nintendo won't just make people pay 5$ or something for the game. Oh wait! Yeah, oh my god I remember now! Nintendo does not care about their fans, that's why every Switch game is 80$ still, hell, it is still 80$ to buy New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe, Nintendo no longer want their fans to be happy, and quite honestly although my friends and I own a Switch, people like us who like story-based games, refuse to play their Switch as I can't afford to spend 80$ a week on a Switch, but I can afford to spend 3$ a week on a PS4/X1.

All this to say, they don't want what their fans want, having a Mario Kart games, with a bunch of old tracks, an uncomfortable playing style as it is on a phone, and paying copious amounts of money is unreasonable, Nintendo should have a balance. They couldn't even care enough about it to add My Nintendo challenges, and I don't know if they will.

[Mario Kart DS] Two track flyover themes?,"This isn’t very important, it’s just something I have been wondering for quite a while since I bought Mario Kart DS.
When you’re playing a Grand Prix, obviously before you start a race you get the “flyover” of the track, in which the camera just shows a couple of clips of the course you’re about to play (I’m sure I shouldn’t need to explain it). Accompanying this is a short song. Yeah, cool, Mario Kart is all about its music. But in Mario Kart DS, there are 2 of these music themes, not one.

9. Mario Kart Tour - this fucking piece of shit freemium EA in disguise motherfucker can go burn in the lowest circle of hell. Controls are horrible, the vertical screen is such a stupid design as the camera is way too close to the character, the item warning is slow and unresponsive until the last second and don’t get me started on micro transactions. What were Nintendo thinking with this game

8. Mario Kart 64 - I really don’t like this game. I used to play it as a little child and I tried to get back into it for nostalgia but this game is so unfulfilling. The controls are shit, the tracks are really boring (except for Bowser’s castle and Toad’s turnpike) and the music isn’t as good as people think it is. I really wanted to give this game the benefit of the doubt but I just don’t like it. It’s still infinitely better than EA kart.

7. Super Mario Kart - this is the most primitive of the Mario Kart games but it is also underrated. The track selection is fine and the music is decent but this game is very flawed. The split screen isn’t really awkward, drifting is really hard to do, the fucking rubber banding AI is so unfair and the item roster is OK at best. I think that despite its flaws, it’s a more fulfilling experience than 64

6. Mario Kart Super Circuit - this is similar to SMK in a way because they’re both 16 bit kart racers. MKSC is, however, a much more polished game. Tracks are really creative, music is decent and it introduces retro tracks to the franchise. It does have its shortcomings. Drifting is a bit messy, characters models are outdated and it is a bit annoying with items (it introduced the coin,  THE COIN)

5. Mario Kart 7 - honestly, this game feels like both a step in the right and wrong direction. It tries to be a worthy successor to DS while also being its own thing. Tracks are great, Music is amazing, character roster is decent and controls are good. It just feels off in a certain area. It feels as this game is trying too hard to be MKDS and it’s own thing. It’s the victim of an identity crisis 

4. Mario Kart Wii - I have a love hate relationship with this game. On the one hand, I love the tracks, they’re some of the best in the series, the soundtrack is the best of all Mario Kart Games, the characters and vehicles were cool, battle mode was amazing and online is fantastic with a great community. On the other hand, the item roster is awful, as it’s the most luck based of any Mario Kart, inside drifting, as fun as it is, is completely broken because outside drift is terrible and most characters are obsolete because Funky Kong is the most OP character. 

3. Mario Kart DS - this game is the most fulfilling when it comes to content. Tracks are amazing (except for figure 8 and baby park), music is great, character roster is fantastic (Dry Bones all the way). That’s not all, both Battle mode is the best in the series. Online was the only thing that could’ve been improved. and Mission Mode was so fun that it’s sad it hasn’t returned in Any games and even sadder that Nintendo cancelled it for Wii. It’s also (forgive me, Wii fans) the most competitive game in the series. Every track feels as though it’s made for competitive play and online was such a good example of this. Plus snaking was so much fun though a very controversial mechanic. It’s sad that this game doesn’t have as large an audience as Wii.

2. Mario Kart Double Dash - this game is MK perfection. The tracks are amazing, the music is stellar, the character roster is fantastic and battle mode is the best behind DS. And the controls are so good for this game that it’s crazy. Honestly, this is the perfect Mario Kart game. 

1. Mario Kart 8/DX - now hear me out. This game is the most flawed of all the Mario Kart games. They fucked up battle mode and the character roster. Online is a hollow shell compared to DS and Wii and it doesn’t have as competitive a feel as the previous four games. But I can’t put it’d own. It’s so much fun. The tracks are amazing and the ones that aren’t all that bad when compared to the previous four (boring, most certainly). The music, while not the best, is superb, and controls are so good that they’re on par with DD and DS. Despite the hollowness of online, the MK8 community is fantastic and I certainly feel they’re as good as the MKWii community. Again, this is the most flawed game in the series and I feel as though the game had so missed potential. They could’ve gone above and beyond but they fell short. Despite these shortcomings, this is my favourite game because I think it’s the most fun

Objectively best

9. Mario Kart Tour - Absolutely terrible. Controls are annoying, tracks look like shitty clay and the fucking microtransactions

8. Super Mario Kart - the most primitive game in the series but so much better than Mario Kart Tour

7. Mario Kart Super Circuit - Retro tracks were introduced to this game but it feels a lot like Super Mario Kart so it’s only slightly better than Super Mario Kart.

6. Mario Kart 64 - the first game in 3D was better than the OG game and the first handheld. It has a better track list than them and multiplayer is better than both.

5. Mario Kart 8/DX - the most flawed game in the series. This reason could be a reason to put it at the bottom but it has a much better physics engine, multiplayer and track list than the other games.

4. Mario Kart 7 - the track list is really good and the multiplayer is solid. Online is pretty good compared to DS. Physics engine is also solid

3. Mario Kart Wii - best soundtrack out of all the games and so of the best tracks and cups in the series. Online is the best out of any game and multiplayer is the best behind 1st. Broken physics make it loads more fun than it needs to be sometimes

2. Mario Kart DS - the best physics behind 1st and some really fantastic tracks. Online is lacking but the content available within DS makes it one of the best in the series and slightly higher than Wii

1. Mario Kart Double Dash - the best game in the series and what I think is the perfect Mario Kart experience. The tracks are on par with Wii, the soundtrack is great, multiplayer is some of the best in the series and the physics in the game are very refined along side DS and make it the objectively best. It feels more refined than the games before and after it and just feels like it was made for a combination of both competitive and casual audiences

Overrated Mario Kart Games

Mario Kart 64, Mario Kart 8, Mario Kart DS and Mario Kart Wii

Mario Kart 64 is a very bad game, in my opinion. It doesn’t have the refined controls of the newer games and lots of people seem to like the game for nostalgia

Mario Kart 8 is my favourite game but it’s highly overrated. Most people who play it seem to dismiss all the other games in the series even though, objectively, it isn’t as good as Wii or Double Dash

Mario Kart DS is another overrated game. While the physics are great and the content is fantastic, online was really lacking and stuff such as snaking made people hate it because they could abuse a mechanic over and over again making competitions unfair

Mario Kart Wii is both an overrated and underrated game. It’s underrated because people scream it’s broken as don’t see the game as anything more than a Bethesda game in Mario Kart skin but it’s overrated because lots of people also see it as the most perfect thing ever created. I agree that the tracks and soundtrack are legendary, but the game can be unfair sometimes.",mariokart

9. Mario Kart Tour - this fucking piece of shit freemium EA in disguise motherfucker can go burn in the lowest circle of hell.

Frenzy,[removed],mariokart
Frenzies [MKT],"I offer a simple question about a questionable game, Mario Kart Tour [MKT]. As we all know, there is a points system in the game, which can be boosted by using favorable karts and gliders. Points can also be boosted by getting frenzies, which grants invinciblity and an item rush (crazy points). My friends have always debated about the frenzies. Is it fair, or is it a form of “legal cheating?” (Since not every character can pull such a crazy move). Does it not matter, because we are only fighting cpus, or is it bad game design to give a random chance of advantage that can be bought through micro transactions? Thoughts?",mariokart
What is Your Thoughts and Opinions on [MKT],"Is it a good game that's worth the money put into it? Is it just a cash grab? Does it stack up well against other Mario Karts like DS, Wii and 8 Deluxe? Is it a missed opportunity by Nintendo to allow more player freedom and competitive by lowering Time Trials down to just a mission? Does it really go well with gacha?",mariokart
[MKT] Should I reset the pipe for better odds at getting high end specials?,"Whenever I win a high end special or high end item (which happens A LOT) the chance for the item and the items “next” to it goes to 0%, and the common items’ percentages rise up to 2%. Just for the chance to get another high end special at 1% (instead of 0%), should I reset the pipe every time I fire? Or is there something I’m missing? Thanks.",mariokart
"So, I've just 3 starred all of the grand prix in mario kart 8 deluxe, about to start 200cc, and I gotta say, I'm really dissapointed....","Theres nothing unlocked for that? What happened to rewarding the player for doing well? In mario kart DS you got a special character and kart for doing super well. Specifically, 3 starring all cups in all speeds let you use any character with any kart. Now, I get the MK8 deluxe has that already, but honestly I wish there was SOMETHING for getting ONLY first in so many cups and courses. But no, it's all about the coin collecting now. 

Listen, I love mk8, I love how it looks, feels, and the customization. But I think im going to skip the next mario karts that follow this unlock model. I dont want to only be rewarded for collecting coins. Give me something for coming in 1st, like any other racing game does. Giving credit where it's due, you Do get the golden kart for getting 1st in all cups up to mirror mode, but nothing for all 2 star and all 3 star. Even mario kart 7 gave you both the wheels and the body of the golden set for 3 starring, and that's twice what mk8 gives you. 

Sorry, rant over. I'm just salty I spent so much time and effort in one of my favorite mario games to be rewarded with nothing. I cant be the only one that thinks this way right?",mariokart

How I Would Balance CTGP in [MKWii],"As ive been seeing thought TWD98 and his videos, its possible to do all sorts of things in CTGP such as item rain and 9999 CC.  However, I honestly get bored with how everything is Funky Kong and Flame Runner or Daisy and Mach Bike.  So I feel that they should use their software to balance the game and make it so theres more variety in online play.  So heres how I would balance the game (no nerfs, just buffs):

* Karts would have a third stage of boost similar to the one in MK8DX with purple sparks.  Using this stage will give the karts a monstrous boost.

* Jetsetter would have a buff in base stats: +5 Weight, +3 Acceleration, +4 Handling, +5 Drift, +3 Off Road, and +5 Mini Turbo.  Stats will now be 69 Speed, 61 Weight, 24 Acceleration, 21 Handling, 32 Drift, 19 Off Road and 21 Mini Turbo.

* Bikes with outward drift will have access to the second stage of miniturbo.",mariokart

e.g.:

this kart is one of the most popular

Use this bike and then this kart in this road and you will see the difference in drifting

Try this kart and you will see that heavy weight with low handling sucks

I hope Mario Kart 9 goes crazy with re-imagining its retro tracks [MK],"It's safe to say that Retro Tracks are here to stay, but I was never that huge of a fan of them in DS/Wii/7. Most of them were just carbon copies of their original tracks that failed to add anything new or exciting. Tracks like SNES Donut Plains 1 and Wii Maple Treeway feel redundant when they're so samey compared to their original versions. Thankfully, Mario Kart 8 made some great strides towards making Retro Tracks feel new and exciting. GC Sherbet Land had a brand new underwater segment, DS Wario Stadium has half of the track in anti-gravity mode, and GBA Ribbon Road is almost unrecognizable. Imagine if Mario Kart 9 went this bombastic with every retro track in the game. What if the SNES Vanilla Lakes had a much larger, winding road that wraps around the water. Or what if GBA Rainbow Road went even crazier with its ramps and shortcuts? GCN Wario Colosseum with insane anti-gravity segments would be my dream",mariokart

A Feature that involves upgrading a low tier character [MKT],"I just thought of a feature that can be introduced into Mario Kart Tour that could not only add more replayability to Mario Kart Tour, but a way to allow characters of low rarity into higher scoring potential.  This is similar to Fire Emblem Heroes' Awakening feature.

Let me walk you through it: Lets say I want to upgrade Shy Guy who starts out as a Common character, but what if I want to turn him into a Super character to increase his scoring? Well, with an ""Awakening"" feature, I can upgrade Shy Guy from a Common character into a Super character and higher into a High End character with enough investment.

You see, many gacha games follow the same format.  Jagen in Fire Emblem Heroes for example can be pulled as either a 3 star or 4 star character, but through awakening, he can be turned into a 5 star character, allowing me to further a strategy I want with him and building him how I want into his maximum potential.

The same can be implemented in Mario Kart Tour: Shy Guy starts out as a Common character, but through Awakening or something similar to it, Shy Guy can be upgraded into a Super character allowing him to have more score and more leveling up potential. Then if I want to push him further, through heavier investments, I can turn him into a High End character that can go on equal footing against people like Dry Bowser, Metal Mario, etc.

You see this feature is needed because right now, High End characters are highly used over other tiers since they have more ""powerful"" weapons and favored courses even though lowered tier have just as much if not more.  The game favors score and allowing a character you like that has your favorite weapon that puts them on equal footing with High End characters make investment into your favorite character even if they started as a Common character makes that investment worthwhile.

The same feature can be implemented into karts and gliders too.  It allows me to the Pipe Frame on equal footing with the B Dasher.  But what would be the costs of turning someone in a lowering tier into a higher tier? Well their score and skill uogrades would be reset, a trait shared by Fire Emblem Heroes, thus giving you more opportunities to replay the game.",mariokart

[MKT] Good things about Mario Kart Tour,"Mario Kart Tour is obviously a very flawed game, with the pay-to-win model and over-simplified gameplay being main detractors. But  I think the game has actually done a lot of things right that I hope are incorporated into Mario Kart 9 (10?).

* *An evergrowing character roster.* Sure, a significant amount of the characters are reskins or re-outfitted. But I do think it keeps the game fresh to have a steady stream of new characters added into the game. By the end of 2019, there will be 52 playable characters and that number will continue to increase with every tour.

* *Re-imagining the same course in multiple ways.* I think the R, T, and R/T tracks are here to stay. They can turn a track into a completely different course without having to create new assets. They keep things fresh.

* *Frenzy Mode.* It’s controversial, but I think frenzies are a great development. The only thing I’m not particularly a fan of is that only certain characters can get frenzies on certain tracks, but that’s not a very big issue.",mariokart

My two kids are getting swtiches for christmas (Yay!) they are 6 and 8, and have grown up on the Nintendo Wii with MarioKart and Super Smash Brothers Brawl. Now we are getting Mario Kart Deluxe 8 and Super Smash Brothers for the switch. They do take long trips from Phila to Queens alot, and we wanted them to be able to play each other on the way up and back.

Will they require 1 or 2 Mario Karts and will they require 1 or 2 Super Smash Brothers. I remember with the DS, we only needed one Mario Kart game. Is it the same way? 1 game for two counsels? I cant find an easy way to ask this to the web, but Reddit has always been on point! Thank you in advance!",mariokart
Dream DLC for MK8DX,[removed],mariokart
Dream DLC for [MK8DX],"This is just a few ideas of what I would like to see in some well-deserved DLC for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

At least 1 new cup:

The Cap Cup :

-Bonneton track. You drive through the cap kingdom, with some fun anti-gravity parts and driving through the fog.

- New Donk City track, driving through the city. Similar to toad's turnpike, except with the taxis driving around.

- Luncheon kingdom track. You drive down Mount Volbono, which will erupt (or the bird will spill soup) in the third lap. Imagine a mix between mount Wario and DK mountain.

- Yet another Bowser's Castle, but following the cap Cup theme, it's based on the Mario odyssey kingdom.


New Characters:
Pauline
Funky Kong
Diddy Kong
Professor E. Gadd
Petey Piranha
Birdo
Ashley (Wario Ware)
Kamek

Maybe also:
The Broodals
Geno
Oxidised copper Pauline (in reference to the metallic green statue of liberty in new York).
Cat Bowser

Non-mario characters:
Possibly a Rabbid to celebrate Mario + Rabbids kingdom battle's 3rd anniversary
Zelda
Sonic

 Car parts:
Minecart - body/tyres
The poltergust from LM3 - body
The R.O.B stand - body
Some of the cars from Stunt Race FX - body/tyres
Taxi - body
Coopa car - body/tyres
Coins - tyres
Wario's bike from smash - body/tyres


I also want a hard-to-get unlock vehicle that is a ball the character balances on, like those levels in Super Mario galaxy games. That sounds like a lot of work on new animations and mechanics though, It would just be nice for more unique vehicles.

This is by no means an extensive list, so comment your own ideas! We all know Mario kart needs some extra DLC, especially since it's the best selling switch game by far and hasn't properly been given new content since 2015. Maybe the new DLC pack could be released in April 2020, to celebrate the 5-year anniversary of the last DLC pack.",mariokart

[MKDS] Waluigi Pinball - Overrated.,"So first of all, I just want to do what I think is an honest review of Waluigi Pinball. The #1 track of all time as everyone claims it to be. However, this is an actual, honest review of the course.

The theme is unique, but for a track called ""Waluigi Pinball"", you sure spend only about 5 seconds on the pinball table, and even then, you are mostly going in a straight line. Also, its only a matter of time before Nintendo tries to make another pinball themed track.

The music is pretty good, I'll give it that, but it shares its music with Wario Stadium, so it isn't THAT special. 

The overall enjoyment isn't high however. It's a pinball track, but whats most of the track? Slanted zig zags, turns, etc? There's one massive jump above of a hole but most of us don't even see it as a threat. 

I'll give it credit. It IS original, but there were several other original courses in DS. Luigi's Mansion, Delfino Square, Shroom Ridge (just kidding what the heck even is shroom ridge), Tick Tock Clock, Airship Fortress, Peach Gardens, etc.

So in a nutshell:

\- Theme = Original, but only meh.

\- Music = Knee slapping, but it isn't 100% original.

\- Enjoyment = Can't be much. It's just a few turns, one jump, and then a pinball table where you just go straight.

&amp;#x200B;

Waluigi Pinball, in my opinion (even though i tried to base this off other peoples opinions too), is not the S-tier track everybody says it is.",mariokart

"Idea fora new game mode, inspired by [Mario Kart Tour]","Before I start, I’m not sure if anyone has posted anything about this or has had this idea before. Ok, let’s get into it

So I’ve been playing Mario Kart Tour a lot more recently and I’m enjoying it. Due to more characters and karts being available, you can get higher scores and that makes the experience better. I haven’t spent any money on this game, never will, but I can launch 10 pipes roughly at the end of every tour. So I was playing and I had a thought: “What if there’s is a score mode in a future Mario Kart?”

Now, what do I mean by a “score mode”, you may ask. After originally thinking the new mode in MK9 would work exactly like MKT (choosing characters, karts, gliders specifically for each track, with base points varying) I decided that it would just be easier to get given a set combination of character, kart and a glider. 

One thing that I’ve forgotten to mention, which is pretty important, would be that this is an online mode and you can only play it with an NSO subscription (given this is on switch). Every week or few days, there would be a new track and combo for everyone to use. The tier system could be used, just like in MKT. Outperforming everyone by a mile? Move up a tier. Not performing well? Move down or stay in same tier. I’m not sure what the prize would be for winning though, so if anyone has any suggestions please let me know!

I appreciate and welcome any feedback, thank you for reading if you have read this far. Hopefully they implement something like this as MKT’s score system is an amazing idea, just don’t add micro transactions 😂",mariokart
[MKT] (Long) When a game makes you pay 50 bucks for one character - A list of problems with Mario Kart Tour,"Hey everyone! 

So, this game came out three months ago, and I think it’s time to unwrap some thoughts on it. It’s received lots of criticism, lots of complaints, lots of feedback  but I’m trying to make this a near-exhaustive list of issues. Not all of it will be objective, but most of it will aim at being so, as some things are… well, pretty unbelievable, when laid out clearly. 

I will warn you right away… this is a long thread, because there was a lot to say, and this is meant to be directed both at MK Tour players, and at people who play actual Mario Kart games and have skipped this application. Scroll down to the end for a TLDR if you want. 

Even with all that, it’s still a nice game to pass time, enjoyable when playing it without caring – and without intentions to spend money – and if you like the game, you wouldn’t do yourself a favor by changing your mind. But these points deserve to be brought up. 

---

**1) The prices**

Everything in this game is vastly, vastly overpriced. But let’s show what this means when putting some numbers on things. I’ll also put everything in euros, because that’s my currency. You’ll note that everything in this game costs fewer dollars than euros, despite one euro being worth more than one dollar. 

&amp;nbsp; 

*a) Gold pass*

The gold pass costs 5.50€ a month, or **66€ a year**, in order to unlock 200cc and some more rewards. 

&amp;nbsp; 

*b) Gems*

The smallest amount of rubies purchasable costs 2.30€, and lets you buy… nothing. You need 5 rubies to get anything, and you get 3 for that price. The next thing you can buy is 10 rubies at once, for 7€, so you cannot buy anything that’s useful on its own for less than 7€. Lastly, the biggest bundle of rubies costs 75€, which is a ridiculous number to see, but I’ll go back on that in a bit. 

&amp;nbsp; 

*c) Drivers and vehicles*

Drivers, karts and gliders are separated into three tiers – Normal, Super, and High-end, with both “quality” and price of the item going up with the tiers. A Super item costs 2000g/3000g (for vehicle parts / drivers), and a High-end one costs 10000g/12000g. 

Let’s just see how much that takes. In terms of gold, you are limited to earning 300g a day from races. Add the tour gifts and challenges (up to 1700g per tour), and if you always complete your daily gold and challenges, you get 5900g in 14 days. So, it only takes 29 days of farming to get one high-end driver! And then you need to wait for one to show up in the shop, as they’re very rare there.  
Now, the thing is that you can convert rubies into coins. 5 rubies convert into 800g, through Coin Rush (no increasing returns for buying more at once). So in order to earn 12000g, you will need 75 rubies. Since there’s no option of buying 75 directly, that would be 48 + 23 + 3 + 3, which will cost **48.60€**. 

Last option is the pipe! This game includes lootboxes in the form of the pipe. You can launch one random item from the pipe for 5 rubies, or 10 items for 45 rubies. The contents of the pipe are regulated such that every 100 launches will yield a set quantity of items in each tier, and in each category (6 high-end, 20 super, 74 normal). 

Making the assumption that high-end items will appear evenly (one every 17 launches), that’s 80 rubies to get one *at random*. Or **51€**. 

&amp;nbsp; 

*d) Recapitulating the prices*

- Minimum amount of rubies usable autonomously: 7€

- Largest rubies bundle: 75€

- Gold pass: 66€ per year

- One driver: Up to 49€ through the shop, 51€ through lootboxes

- Enough rubies to buy every high-end driver, kart, and glider (only the high-end ones): 3984€

- Enough rubies to buy every high-end driver, kart, and glider, and to put them all to max level: 39840€ ($44143)

- Enough rubies to buy every driver, kart, and glider, and put them all to max level: 58190€ ($64475)

That’s right! 40 thousand bucks to only get most of the content in this game, 60k for the entirety. 

In comparison… 

- One brand new Switch game: 46€

- Switch online pass: 17.70€ a year (27% of the Gold pass’ price)

- Google pass: Equivalent to 4.50€ a month, or 54€ a year (82% of the Gold pass’ price, giving access to hundreds of games)

-----

**2) Mario Kart Tour, brought to you by EA Games**

Most of you surely remember how much of a sense of pride and accomplishment one gets when paying to unlock Darth Vader in Battlefront II through lootboxes, when pretty much the main character of the series isn’t available to play by default. Thankfully, in case you missed that feeling, Mario Kart Tour brings it back for you! You begin the game with Toad available, and either Peach or Bowser. How do you get Mario? Lootboxes! Or you wait for him to show up in the shop, and spend 10 days’ worth of coins on him. As for Luigi, despite being ready since the beta of the game, he only became available a month later. 

But a *Mario* game not letting you play as Mario without buying him through lootboxes or other sorts of randomized processes… 

---


**3) Faking an online system**

As mentioned before, the game doesn’t include online play yet, even three months after the game’s release. It does, however, fake having it. Each race matches you against 7 bots *that have the username of an actual human player*. This obviously doesn’t bring the user anything, so it wasn’t done with the player’s interests in mind. People can, however, take things more seriously and be more prone to buying things if they see they’re losing to players with a better gear than theirs. 

Dishonesty in order to get more money from the users, by making them believe things that aren’t true. 

Now, it’s pretty easy to find out that the game isn’t multiplayer. “Multiplayer” option hidden in the menus, short loading times, ability to start the game immediately after skipping the introduction, and most blatantly ability to switch to another app and then resume your race right where you left it. But these aren’t obvious things, and you can easily miss them, especially when uninformed, because *just why would the game not be multiplayer, when you can see the names of all other players in your race?*

---

**4) The sense of pride and accomplishment strikes back**

Here’s going into the pay to win aspect of the game. Each race awards you points based on “how well you race” – with necessary quotation marks because the actions netting you the most points are often not the ones resulting in a fast driving. 

The points you earn are directly based on what driver and vehicle you use, as each track has a small sample of drivers/vehicles letting you gain far more points than the others – usually, something around 3 drivers, 3 karts, and 2 gliders. **Most of the advantageous drivers/vehicles of each course are high-end.** For most courses, all but one “optimal” racers/karts/gliders are high-end. Sometimes, *all* of them are. And if you’re not using the elements that have a synergy with your track, you’ll have a hard time matching the points other people can get on it. 

So far, the game is only single player, with one way of “measuring” yourself to others – the ranked cup. Each week, one cup will be the ranked cup, with the rank of each person being based on how many points they earned in each of its three tracks. Your score is measured against that of 19 other players, and you get rewards based on how high you place at the end of the week. Which is where the problem of the pay to win aspect lies. 

My biggest problem with that part is the existence of tracks where **only** high-end drivers/karts/gliders have a “synergy” with the track. High-end items are already advantageous enough on their own (giving more points overall, and synergizing with a lot more tracks) for them to deserve being mandatory on certain cups. 

-----

**5) The lazy ways to create content and cash grab**  

*a) The actual diversity*

Character and vehicle diversity are nice things. Sure, I can’t get enough of Funky Kong with Flame Runner, but having a more varied cast of characters and a wider array of usable vehicles is neat. With 52 drivers, 63 karts and 36 gliders, Mario Kart Tour offers exactly that, right? Right?  
Well…  
Not exactly. Two problems with all that. Let’s start with the first one (I guess it wouldn’t be called first otherwise, after all), and the second one will be the next part. 

Drivers aren’t too bad. It just feels like there wasn’t too much work put in when we receive a 5th version of Mario, or a 5th outfit for Peach. 

Karts and gliders, on the other hand… well… let me show you some pictures, rather than words. Let’s look at some karts side by side. 

[Bullet Blaster vs. Bull’s-Eye Banzai](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/412666600332984340/656880242580783124/unknown.png)

[Cheep Charger vs. Green Cheep Charger](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/412666600332984340/656880818165121034/unknown.png)

[DK Jumbo vs. Chrome DK Jumbo](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/412666600332984340/656881344663650325/unknown.png)

Surely, gliders can’t be worse, right? Well, I’ll let you figure out for yourselves. 

[Cloud Glider vs. Rainy Balloons](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/412666600332984340/656882250339581954/unknown.png)

[Super Glider vs. Gold Glider vs. Le Tricolore](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/412666600332984340/656882764322177054/unknown.png)

So… yeah. So much for variety, when the work put in in order to create a new vehicle part can range from “swapping one color” to “swapping three colors”. And let’s make the matter worse with a small list of facts. 

- None of the above pairs even present any gameplay differences. For each case, you can swap one with the other and get the exact same bonuses. 

- Put the [Cheep Charger](https://www.mariowiki.com/File:MKT_Icon_CheepCharger.png)’s sprite in one tab, and the [Green Cheep Charger](https://www.mariowiki.com/File:MKT_Icon_GreenCheepCharger.png)’s in another. Swap between the two tabs, you’ll see that the **only** difference between the two is the red changed into green. Not a single other color was changed. Makes you wonder how the colorblind version of the game would look. 

- The Cloud Glider and Rainy Balloons are both high-end gliders, meaning a coin value of 49€. The Rainy Balloons was “tour-exclusive spotlight” content, meaning that the only way to get it was with a 1% chance through lootboxes. In other words, spending 225€ (lowest price to get ≥450 rubies) nets you a nice 50% chance of getting this item. And with both items being overpriced like this, the only difference between the two is a color swap, and that’s it. 

- If we remove all the color changes, we wind up having 39 different karts and 29 gliders, down from 63 and 36. 38% of the karts are simply color changes from another kart. 

That still leaves us with decent quantities, so let’s move on to the second part of the issue. 

&amp;nbsp; 

*b) The proportions per price tiers*

The second problem is how many of the items are high-tier. 

Drivers used to have a repartition that would make some sense – after the first update, 14 normal drivers, 13 in the super tier, and 7 high-end ones. 

But since the start of November, we’ve received 4 super drivers, 8 high-end ones, and… no normal ones (I haven’t seen these Super ones in the shop, so I could be wrong, but pending further information, I’ll assume they can only be redeemed through the “special offers” or lootboxes). As they seem to continue this trend of adding two high-ends and one offer-only super per tour… you can see where the roster is headed. More super expensive / exclusive characters means more and more chances that the new courses only favor unaffordable drivers. 

The same thing happens with karts and gliders, too. There are 63 karts, sorted as follows: 

- Normals: 9

- Pass-exclusive normal: 6

- Supers: 16

- Pass-exclusive supers: 6

- High-ends: 27 (including 6 pass-exclusive) 

Only 25/63 karts are accessible and really affordable without spending money, or less than 40%. No  normal kart has been released since the start of November, and only 4 super karts (plus two exclusive ones), for *14* high-end ones. There again, you can see the trend by yourselves, and the conclusion is the same. 

Same story for the gliders, I don’t need to develop once more. 

To sum all of this up – Lots of the content feels really unnecessary with a good part of it taking very limited effort, only being there as a way to make the players want to buy the gold pass, or to make more money be spent. In the process, this is also progressively “nerfing” the free to play playerbase.  
And you can’t even play Funky Kong, either. 

---

**6) Some questionable mistakes and oversights**

*a) False information about maxed out points*

The experience points you earn for drivers, karts, and gliders eventually maxes out. There is also a limited amount of experience you can earn each day (150). When you play a race with a maxed out gear (or partially maxed out), the experience will be wasted: you won’t earn anything, and it will still tick down. 

Here is what the game tells you **whenever you get a star in a tour you already got everything in:** [“Drivers, karts, gliders, and Grand Stars cannot accrue above the max limit. The remainder will become coins.”](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/412666600332984340/657732445952802847/Screenshot_20191201-144209_Mario_Kart.jpg)

Now, to begin with, it’s already weird that you can find this information *about driver/vehicle experience* only *when getting extra stars at the end of a tour*. 

Second… don’t bother too much about this popup. It’s a lie. For the stars, it’s telling the truth, for the experience, it’s not. You gain nothing from wasting experience on maxed out items. You can test that by yourself: get your 300 daily race coins, then (before finishing your daily experience, which takes longer than the coins) go in a race with a maxed out combo, and see that you’ll have earned nothing by the end of it. 

&amp;nbsp; 

*b) The error with the pipe details*

The pipes have a Details tab, showing what exact content you can get in the pipe, and with which odds – in lots of countries, this is a mandatory thing for the lootboxes to be allowed. But…  lately, I’ve had this tab often just not work. Instead, it would simply show [this](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/412666600332984340/657737635577462803/unknown.png) error message. I can try again as much as I want, it’s not gonna work (until I restart the app), however, I can still fully access the pipe and put money in it. So… you can have access to the pipe, without having access to its details (until force closing the app and restarting it). 

&amp;nbsp; 

*c) Challenges asking to do something impossible*

This didn’t really belong in any category, so I just put it there. 

Each week, you can climb up to 3 tiers in rank. So the highest you could be after 6 weeks was tier 19. The highest tier used to be 20, and it remained that way until two weeks ago. Until then, you’d reach tier 20, and then stay there even when being top of your group, slowing everyone’s progress down by up to 11 tiers ([…] -&gt; 19 -&gt; 20 -&gt; 20 -&gt; 20 -&gt; 20 -&gt; 23 -&gt; 26 instead of […] -&gt; 19 -&gt; 22 -&gt; 25 -&gt; 28 -&gt; 31 -&gt; 34 -&gt; 37). 

Now here’s the problem. One of the challenges asks you to get to tier 30 (Standard challenges 2-4), another one asks you to get to tier 40 (Standard challenges 2-5). You could get access to the challenge “Reach tier 30” as soon as you reached tier 20… meaning that the game would ask you to get to a tier that did not exist at the time, and wouldn’t exist until a month later. 

&amp;nbsp; 

*d) No rewards for reaching milestones*

Once again, didn’t really belong anywhere, but it’ll go there as well. 

Reaching the next level nets you 100 coins, or 5 rubies if said level is a multiple of 5. That’s it. This is the universal formula, with no exceptions. Reaching level 50 gives you 5 rubies. **Reaching the max level gives 100 coins.** It feels… very wrong, and neglectful.

**7) The online play**

I tried the beta of that in order to be able to write a more thorough post on all of this. I wanted to send some footage, and thankfully, said footage fits in a screenshot: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/412666600332984340/657343204693245972/Screenshot_20191219-110927_Mario_Kart.jpg

More seriously, I’ve been repeatedly getting that error before being able to join a race. And once I did… I got kicked out a second after the start with the same message. This happened both on wifi with full bars, and on 4G+ with equally good network. 

I still managed to get into three lobbies. And… there are some good things, but the quality of the server doesn’t seem to be one of them. Each player is really lagging, teleporting around, your trail breaks without any hit appearing on your screen, or you see people spin out then teleport ahead because they weren’t actually hit. Getting lagged on arrival is also still a thing. 

Mario Kart Wii’s multiplayer runs on custom, unofficial servers, yet it still offers a much more stable connection than what Tour has shown me today. Thankfully, it’s just a beta. But… I don’t know how hopeful I can risk being. 

The format is also pretty boring. Every 30 minutes, a cup is selected, and you will play the three races of that cup, in order, *and on repeat until the end of these 30 minutes*. That’s it, you’re sticking to these three tracks. There is also no ranking, and nothing to keep track of anything during the game, and coins, driver/vehicle experience, or player experience aren’t affected. 

---

**8) This game feels like it has received a very, very low amount of testing**

All games, even all websites have bugs. [I’m used to that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8fcwr7/and_to_conclude_the_streak_with_over_300_book/) But some things in there are baffling, even then. Things extremely easy to come across, and that were still shipped. 

&amp;nbsp; 

*a) Typos on words that players come across very frequently*

“Star Tickets” and “Quick Tickets” used to be spelled without the uppercase. [Example](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/412666600332984340/657424909961789440/unknown.png). All other tickets were fine (Item Ticket, Point-Boost Ticket, Level-Boost Ticket, Coin Rush Ticket).

Does it affect the gameplay a lot? Sure not. But, you see the name of that ticket [every single time you tap a cup that’s still locked](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/412666600332984340/657425708787957770/Screenshot_20191220-043444_Mario_Kart.jpg), every single time. It wasn’t fixed before launch, and **it wasn’t even fixed two months later.** 

While: 

- Each person who plays at least a bit will see this, 

- It takes nothing to fix it, only changing two letters. 

And they do patch the game every week at least, so they can implement that whenever. So, is it just that they… never play their game? I really don’t know what can explain that. 

&amp;nbsp; 

*b) Mistakes in tracks noticeable at first glance*

Let’s talk about SNES Rainbow Road, R/T version. The track begins with a left turn. At the end of each race, after crossing the finish line, an AI takes over the kart to keep driving before the next screen loads. In this one track, the AI is always, always going to fall off right after this first turn, always in the same manner. 

Once again, almost nothing impacting the gameplay, but it looks really stupid and bad, and it happens systematically and cannot be skipped. This means that there is no way that dev or QA person who played this track missed it. CPUs would sometimes get stuck on that turn forever, and stay at the beginning of the first lap while the race is ending – [you can see where this Toad is](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/412666600332984340/657429474584952868/Screenshot_20191128-143058_Mario_Kart.jpg). 

Another track had the same problem (SNES Rainbow Road R, if I’m not mistaken), but not systematically. 

&amp;nbsp; 

*c) Actual gameplay bugs*

This was put after the first two categories, because you almost have half a way to miss them, unlike the ones above. Most of the problems come from 200cc, not all do. All of these issues come with jumps, though. 

- **Koopa Troopa Beach T:** Halfway into the game comes a ramp leading to a platform that a dinosaur watches over. Using a shroom or being in a Mega mushroom when taking that ramp makes you collide with the dino’s head, which sends you flying and immediately puts you out of bounds. **When playing in 200cc, this jump will very frequently send you out of bounds without needing to use any items.**

- **Dino Dino Jungle T:** Same problem with the dinosaur, simply less frequently. 

- **Toad Circuit T:** A glider ramp comes out on lap 2. On 200cc, you don’t reach the ground from that glider before the next trickable part without nosediving immediately. If you don’t do this, that next trickable thing shoots you over the tunnel that comes right next. This sends you immediately out of bounds.

- **Ghost Valley 1 – Any version:** The cardboard shortcut will randomly not give you enough height when tricking off of it. Whether you do it with a shroom, without one, drifting, without drifting, on 150 or on 200, it can happen in any case and is simply inconsistent. Inconsistency with the meaning of “Doing the same inputs twice can yield different results” isn’t the same as precision, it’s simply a bad thing. 

- **London Loop:** I don’t remember which versions, I know it’s at least two though. Probably normal and T. There’s a bus that you can get on with a ramp on lap 2. On 200cc, tricking off that ramp will not give you any distance – for no reason – and will result in you shooting down in that very small gap between the ramp and the bus. This is an out of bounds area, too. It happened fairly consistently, enough that I managed to reproduce it a second time immediately after respawning, to make sure of what happened. CPUs can also get stuck there – [Peach on the minimap](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/412666600332984340/657435027289669655/Screenshot_20191206-155953_Mario_Kart.jpg). 

- **Rock Rock Mountain T:** The shortcut with the trickable stream of air over the pipes in **Rock Rock Mountain** is… let’s say, precise, probably too precise for the controls this game offers, but that would be taking it to the subjective. The one on the T version of the track, however, is just very inconsistent. It will shoot you out of bounds more often than not, and 200cc makes it far worse. 

- **Mario Circuit R/T:** The shroom section when exiting the castle can send you under the arrival ramp, and out of bounds, without external influence, based on your speed. 

I think that was about all of it, but I might have forgotten one or two. 

On top of the issues that can be found wherever, these problems in 200cc are… rather awful. Because it just feels like the mode was simply created by multiplying the speed by 1.5, and *that’s it.* No checking that *any* track would still work with it. I’m not talking about checking whether the turns are fine – they’re usually not, but that’s 200cc for ya’. No, I’m talking about the tracks… simply functioning. 

Remember when I said Mario Kart Wii had its online play run on custom servers and that these servers happen to run better than the official ones used by Mario Kart Tour? Well, Mario Kart Wii also has a fan-made, unofficial 200cc mod that works a lot better and also took a lot more effort than Tour’s official 200cc. Guess which of the two is free? That’s right,, the one for Mario Kart Wii, the one that took actual work and effort. 

&amp;nbsp; 

*d) Simple gameplay problems* 

- **Bowser’s Castle 1 R:** Racers starting in the back have a major disadvantage on that track (I mean, more than on others), because of the thwomps at the very beginning of the track. Racers in the front don’t need to worry about them, but they fall down before the ones in the back can cross them. 

- **Shy Guy Bazaar R:** The track starts with a glider ramp right after an item set. If you’re in the back, you have high chances of hitting just anyone’s trail, and falling off because of it. 

- **Daisy Hills R:** Similar problem there, the track opens with a ramp after an item set, leading to the same issue. On the plus side, the gliding area is a lot wider, meaning that you’re a lot more likely to have death be less unavoidable. However, the downside is… respawn points. Falling off in that area, anywhere but at the end of it, will respawn you… before the glider ramp. 

Those are just unfun mechanics, that once again feel like they weren’t tested, and gives vibes of unofficial custom tracks rather than officials.

**8) Shoving more and more paid content into people’s faces**

The game has three ways of making people pay: to buy rubies, to buy the gold pass, or to buy packs / special offers. Rubies will be used to get coins for the shop, or to launch the pipe for lootboxes. Each tour has two pipes, each pipe has one (newly released) featured driver, kart, and glider, that can only be obtained by launching that pipe, with a fixed 1% chance for each. 

When the game was released, there were three ways of showing things for people to buy. 

- Each character/vehicle part that is featured in the daily shop will appear with a shop symbol in your collection or when choosing your combo for a race. (This one has its positives, though) 

- Each tour gift contains things for everyone, and things restricted to gold pass holders, and does a good job at tempting into getting the pass by showing all this cool stuff you could get from it. 

- The shop shows you the packs that can only be purchased with money, then the lootboxes available for rubies, and you need to *scroll* to get to the things that coins can buy you. 

And here are the things that were added since: 

- Every time you open a tour gift (or a condition similar to this one, at least), you get a pop-up telling you that you can buy the gold pass, and showing all the things you would receive from doing so. 

- Whenever a new pack is released, you’ll have an announcement popping up about it when you open the game. 

- You can also randomly get a popup about a pack you could buy after finishing a race. 

- The items obtainable in a pack also have their special icon in your collection / combo selection. 

- The items exclusive to a current pipe also have their special icon in your collection / combo selection. 

The very frequent popups being the main part of the problem. 

---

**9) And some other practices to get more money**

*a) Ranked cups* 

That part is very interesting. At the end of each week, each player gets +3, +2, +1, 0, -1 or -2 tiers, and is matched against 19 other players from their tier. The player also receives rewards based on where they placed, and based on their tier. The rewards only improve once you reach tier 11, then tier 21, and reaching tier 21 only makes them noticeably improve for the first place. One important thing to note is that **you gain more for a first place in tier 11 than for a second place in tier 30** (which, come to think of it, doesn’t make too much sense). 

Naturally, this means that every person caring about those rewards will end up struggling more and more to get the most of them. The higher you get in tiers, the more you’ll be matched with people who also want to be first. And the higher you get in tiers, the more you’ll be matched with people who have spent money into the game – naturally, as this makes them get more points. Meaning that it might take weeks, months, but someone who wants to get the first place rewards will eventually be forced into one of two things: passing up on the rewards, or spending money themselves. 

(Note: Players aren’t grouped *together* in ranked groups, you’re put with 19 players who will each have different opponents. You might be the opponent of one of your opponents, but it’s most likely that you aren’t. This does, however, not change that reasoning.)

&amp;nbsp; 

*b) The content of the packs*

Currently, 4 new items are available through packs, one high-end and three supers. I’ll focus on these supers: Birdo, the Turbo Birdo kart and the Pink Flower Glider, the Birdo-themed glider (or for a more accurate description, the Flower Glider colored in pink). They appear in two packs: 

- [The Birdo pack](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/412666600332984340/657406760339898405/Screenshot_20191220-031613_Mario_Kart.jpg): 22€ for 45 rubies and Birdo (and something that’s insignificant). 

- [The Turbo Birdo pack](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/412666600332984340/657406914254077962/Screenshot_20191220-031627_Mario_Kart.jpg): 44€ for 90 rubies, the kart and the glider. 

Those are good deals, rubies for 78%-83% of their price and bonus stuff to go with it – good deals, until you look at how much you have to pay, of course. But the thing is, the main appeal of these packs is the Birdo package – the Turbo pack even reads “Complete the look with Birdo!”  
So, of course, the only way to get all three is by buying both packs, and 135 rubies on the side. And spending 66€. For three items in a phone game. (Reminder that I’ve never seen these pack items in the shop)

---

**11) And lastly, the gameplay**

I’m talking about this last, because while it’s a very important thing, the problems here are the result of mistakes, and not of bad intentions. I will also be very brief in this part, because all the players of this game know what I’m talking about, and because this is where things are more susceptible to getting into the subjective territory. I won’t make sub-parts, either, as I will not develop the points. And this thread is long enough already. 

First, the thing that has bothered me the most – handling. Not having another option to turn than drift made it really hard to drive precisely, and it turns out that the recent addition of the steering button did not really improve things, due to it being a button. The game will very frequently refuse to turn tight enough, not even tight enough to charge a mini-turbo, even when swiping all the way to the opposite direction. When the other Mario Kart game that I currently play is Mario Kart Wii, which probably offers the most responsive and precise driving… you feel a clear difference. 

Second, vertical setting. Plus side, lets you play with one hand, down side, makes you play with one hand instead of offering decent controls. 

Third, on that, the controls. They’re not too bad for the restrictions that they gave themselves. Meaning that they’re bad. Some controls lightly overlap, some are even conflicting. Swipe up or down to throw an item, swipe left or right to turn. It certainly isn’t uncommon to randomly throw an item by initiating a drift, because the initial contact to swipe laterally was detected as tapping. Speaking of tapping, you need to tap the screen to jump (useful on Yoshi Circuit, for example, to skip patches of grass). That *will* use one of your items. I also gave up on looking backwards as it would make me turn more often than not. Add to that drifting going the wrong way more often than on any other console, or items thrown forward instead of backwards… 

Fourth, the smart steering. Whether it’s on or off, same problem, doesn’t matter. It locks you out of taking some shortcuts that you should be able to take, if you just try to cut more offroad than the game likes, even when you have enough shrooms for that distance. The thing supposed to help driving and to make the phone controls less uncomfortable merely creates more awkward situations. 

Fifth, the coins. Your speed used to be based on the amount of coins you held, now it’s not and coins are only there for score purposes (which, as a reminder, doesn’t affect anything in online play). So, as far as *racing* is concerned (which should be pretty much everything, in a *racing* game), coins are an item that does nothing. 

Sixth, the trails. Since everyone trails their item, every driver is a hazard. Which would be nice, if the game offered any kind of handling, but that’s not the case. 

Seventh, the advantage of starting races in first. As a result of the previous point, starting in first is a very big advantage, as you’re the only driver who isn’t stuck in the melee of trailed items. And since the first item box offers no actual last place items (no Bullet Bill, no Shock), this isn’t compensated much. 

Eighth, no possibility of braking or stopping. Bagging becomes very hard because you oftentimes can’t make yourself slower than the last CPU even when you try, and you also don’t get to stop before a boost panel when a red or blue shell would hit you. 

Ninth, some challenges are simply unfun due to how much randomness they imply. Namely, landing hits with Super Horn, spinning over the finish line, landing hits with Shock / flattening opponents. 

Tenth, some Frenzies are very underwhelming. Here’s a list:  

- Mega Mushroom: This frenzy does nothing, it would have the same effect if it were an item-less frenzy (as in… a star). Using a second Mega doesn’t refresh the duration of the first, and the effect of the item lasts exactly as long as the frenzy itself, so you cannot reactivate a second one before the end of the frenzy. 

- Fire Flower: A regular flower throws three fireballs at once, giving it a very wide range. The frenzy lets you fire one ball at once, effectively making it easier to hit people with one fire flower than with an entire frenzy of them. 

- Heart: Theoretically, this could be useful – you can stack up to five hearts. In practice, when you have even two hearts at once, the second will wind up timing out before being consumed. 

- Bubble: That one is rather self-explanatory. Two things I could say. One, same thing as the Mega mushroom. Two, if an item is useless already, a frenzy of it won’t be less inefficient. 

- Blooper (and Shock, I think?): When used in a frenzy, these items won’t hit everyone – if I’m not mistaken, each use will only hit some opponents. 

- Triple Mushroom: A triple mushroom frenzy actually is only a mushroom frenzy. While a triple green frenzy is an actual triple green frenzy, not a regular green shell frenzy. 

Eleventh, following up on that, triple shrooms activating all at once is silly. Bubbles also just feel extremely unfun to use and to receive. 

This is all that comes to mind immediately, I also have more things that would be more subjective (such as saying that so far, all four of the original design tracks are subjectively unfun and make for bad races). 

---

**Conclusion and TLDR**

 I do have a few positives about the game, but this isn’t the purpose of this post, and they really pale in comparison to all the problems. This application is a massive, massive cash grab, piling strategies to make the users spend more money, with a very rushed gameplay and seemingly inexistent testing. They’ve also been very dishonest with the game (faking an online play, really?), and the prices are beyond ridiculous when you look at them (50€ for a single driver at level 1 - *more than a brand new game* - 66€ yearly for the Gold pass, and **60 thousand euros** for all the content). 

Companies make games to make money, nothing new or surprising about that. But the line is drawn where making money is done at the expense of creating an enjoyable experience for the player. And when the Mario Kart franchise hasn’t received a new game since May 2014, over 5.5 years ago (*new* game, not a port), it deserved to receive more care – more care as a game, and not as a product.",mariokart
Online is more about gambling than skill after 5000 VR [Mario Kart 8 Deluxe],"Even when I drive ""perfect"", in the end, 5 seconds before the finish line, I get fucked over by the blue shell. Perfect drifts, item management, start boost, etc. It's all well and good until you get to around 5000 VR. Then you can play versus 10,000+ players while still sub 8,000, and you dominate them all 99% of the map, and then the blue shell hits. The only time when I really feel the skill advantage is against sub 3-4000 players. Otherwise it's all gambling with items and shit. So I gave up on caring about online points now and just play for the fun.",mariokart

What I'd like to see in the next Mario Kart Title [Part One] 🏎,"In this post, I'd like to share a couple ideas of mine for what I'd like to see in the next Mario Kart title, like possible characters and items. This is Part One and I may do another part in the near future discussing tracks and QOL changes. Obviously, my thoughts and judgements will be different to yours, but feel free to leave your ideas and viewpoints, I'd love to hear them. I'm not too sure if people talk about this topic regularly as I'm new to this subreddit, but I'm intrigued to know what other people think.

First of all, I'd like to discuss characters. 
I'd like to start of stating that I think characters should be unlockable. I strongly disliked the idea of getting them right at the start in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. In my opinion, it gives you a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction when unlocking them, especially for the rarer and harder to get ones. However, I think some new ideas need to be created for unlocking them, not just completing cups and time trials. A more unique and intriguing way for example would be if you have used the Piranha Plant item 25 times, it grants you the playable character of Petey Piranha. As for characters themselves, these are who I'd like to see: 

• Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Princess Daisy    and Rosalina
• Baby Mario, Baby Luigi and Baby Peach
• Yoshi, Birdo, Koopa Troopa, Shy Guy, Toad, Toadette, Kamek and Piranha Plant
• Wario, Waluigi, Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Funky Kong, Bowser and Bowser Jr
• Dorrie, Boom Boom, Pom Pom, Draggadon, King Boo and Petey Piranha 
• Mii

I also believe all the characters should have additional costumes, here's a couple of examples:

• Mario has a 'Mario Odyssey' costume, where his hat has eyes, and occasionally, throughout the race, his hat floats around his head as Cappy and returns on his head. He could also have access to different power ups he's had throughout different games like Metal Mario and Fire Mario. I think this would be a better alternative to having them as their separate characters and wasting slots
• Koopa Troopa has the option to have wings, 'Paratroopa' and comes in a variety of colours, like blue, red, purple and yellow like he's done in previous games

I know a couple of the characters may seem odd, like 'Draggadon', I just wanted to list a couple more unique suggestions than the usual 'E-Gadd' and 'ROB'. I also think there should be an option to randomly pick a character as well, which could be displayed as a question mark.

Now onto items. 
I think special items should definetly return, I was very glad to see them in Mario Kart Tour and would like to see them in the next title. 
I'd also like to mention, I think it'd be better to have just one item and not two as I believe it makes the races too hectic and crazy. I honestly think they should remove the blooper as a whole, as it has very little use and is more annoying than useful. And as for no coins, I think that speaks for itself. As for items I think should be available for every character and not exclusive as a special item:

• Mushroom, Green Shell, Red Shell, Banana, Star, Bob-omb, Lightning, Blue Shell and Bullet Bill

As for new items, I think the super crown would be cool, not sure what it'd do but it would be a nice addition.

For special items:

• Mario and Luigi - Big Mushroom
• Peach, Daisy and Luma - Heart Shield
• Baby Mario, Luigi and Peach - Chain Chomp
• Yoshi and Birdo - Eggs
• Koopa Troopa - Triple Shells
• Toad and Toadette - Golden Mushroom
• Kamek - Wand (Homes in on player like red shell, can make them either small, squashed or big for a small amount of time)
• Piranha Plant, Petey Piranha and Draggadon - Fire Balls
• Wario and Waluigi - Double Bombs
• Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong and Funky Kong - Five bananas
• Bowser and Bowser Jr - Bowser Shell
• King Boo - Ghost
• Mii, Boom Boom, Pom Pom, Dorrie and Shy Guy - I'm really not sure

I think adding special items makes you be more wary of the character you pick and can make unlocking some of the more rarer characters more beneficial as they could have better items.

What I'd like to see in the next Mario Kart Title [Part One] [MK] 🏎,"In this post, I'd like to share a couple ideas of mine for what I'd like to see in the next Mario Kart title, like possible characters and items. This is Part One and I may do another part in the near future discussing tracks and QOL changes. Obviously, my thoughts and judgements will be different to yours, but feel free to leave your ideas and viewpoints, I'd love to hear them. I'm not too sure if people talk about this topic regularly as I'm new to this subreddit, but I'm intrigued to know what other people think.

First of all, I'd like to discuss characters. 
I'd like to start of stating that I think characters should be unlockable. I strongly disliked the idea of getting them right at the start in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. In my opinion, it gives you a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction when unlocking them, especially for the rarer and harder to get ones. However, I think some new ideas need to be created for unlocking them, not just completing cups and time trials. A more unique and intriguing way for example would be if you have used the Piranha Plant item 25 times, it grants you the playable character of Petey Piranha. As for characters themselves, these are who I'd like to see: 

• Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Princess Daisy    and Rosalina
• Baby Mario, Baby Luigi and Baby Peach
• Yoshi, Birdo, Koopa Troopa, Shy Guy, Toad, Toadette, Kamek and Piranha Plant
• Wario, Waluigi, Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Funky Kong, Bowser and Bowser Jr
• Dorrie, Boom Boom, Pom Pom, Draggadon, King Boo and Petey Piranha 
• Mii

I also believe all the characters should have additional costumes, here's a couple of examples:

• Mario has a 'Mario Odyssey' costume, where his hat has eyes, and occasionally, throughout the race, his hat floats around his head as Cappy and returns on his head. He could also have access to different power ups he's had throughout different games like Metal Mario and Fire Mario. I think this would be a better alternative to having them as their separate characters and wasting slots
• Koopa Troopa has the option to have wings, 'Paratroopa' and comes in a variety of colours, like blue, red, purple and yellow like he's done in previous games

I know a couple of the characters may seem odd, like 'Draggadon', I just wanted to list a couple more unique suggestions than the usual 'E-Gadd' and 'ROB'. I also think there should be an option to randomly pick a character as well, which could be displayed as a question mark.

Now onto items. 
I think special items should definetly return, I was very glad to see them in Mario Kart Tour and would like to see them in the next title. 
I'd also like to mention, I think it'd be better to have just one item and not two as I believe it makes the races too hectic and crazy. I honestly think they should remove the blooper as a whole, as it has very little use and is more annoying than useful. And as for no coins, I think that speaks for itself. As for items I think should be available for every character and not exclusive as a special item:

• Mii, Boom Boom, Pom Pom, Dorrie and Shy Guy - I'm really not sure

I think adding special items makes you be more wary of the character you pick and can make unlocking some of the more rarer characters more beneficial as they could have better items.

[MK] Which game has the best retro tracks?,"Retro tracks have been apart of the series since the DS era, and I think that’s when many fans of the series started. I love retro tracks because they give a good variety to the game and are a bit of a throwback. But I’ve been wondering, which game has the best set of retro tracks?

DS standouts (my favorites): N64 Moo Moo Farm, GBA Peach Circut, N64 Frappe Snowland, GBA Bowser Castle 2, SNES Koopa Beach 2, N64 Choco Mountain, GBA Luigi Circuit, GCN Mushroom Bridge, SNES Choco Island 2, N64 Banshee Boardwalk, GBA Sky Garden, GCN Yoshi Circuit

Wii standouts (my favorites): SNES Ghost Valley 2, DS Delfino Square, GCN Waluigi Stadium, N64 DK’s Jungle Parkway, GCN DK Mountain, N64 Bowser’s Castle

7 standouts (my favorites): I think retro track is good in this game 

8 standouts (my favorites): I think retro track is good in this game 

I really like the DS selection if not for nostalgia only. I found the Wii’s selection rather boring mostly, but there were still standouts. 7 and 8 both have really good selections, I don’t think I could pick a bad one out, even the “worst” ones are still a blast to ride around.

My rankings:
3. Wii
2. DS
1 (tie). 7 and 8

I can’t choose between the two, even the Shell Cup tracks are a blast, and both games have cult favorites. Which game has your favorite retro track selection?",mariokart

[MK] Something wrong with every Mario Kart game,"As much as I love Mario Kart (I've been playing it for 10 years), even I can admit the games have problems. Nothing's perfect. Here's at least 1 thing that's ""bad"" about every MK game:

Super Mario Kart: Very much the first Mario Kart game. Several things still needed to be ironed out. Mario Kart definitely wasn't meant to be a 2D game, even though Nintendo did great with what they had at the time. The karts feel near impossible to handle, and I find myself hitting a wall almost every race. Also, the AI here is probably the worst, with their ability to spam items whenever they want.

Mario Kart 64: Definitely improved on SMK, but still has some problems. Even though the AI doesn't just spam random items anymore, it still rubberbands a lot. I find the AI karts catching up to me even when I get a huge lead almost every race. Also, even though the controls are improved, the drifting still isn't very good.

Mario Kart Super Circuit: This game was forced to return to 2D graphics being on the GBA (yes, it was because of the hardware's limitations). The game overall feels like a rehash of Super Mario Kart, and definitely feels underwhelming compared to Mario Kart 64.

Mario Kart Double Dash!!: Removes single-player VS mode, even though it was in Super Circuit and removes the option to unlock the retro tracks.

Mario Kart DS: Mario Kart, especially modern Mario Kart, wasn't meant for the D-pad in my opinion. Also, snaking. Why did it have to be snaking? 

Mario Kart Wii: Completely unbalanced. There is a clear advantage between karts and bikes, especially inside-drifting bikes. Choosing a lightweight character is basically a death sentence. Also, while the items themselves are great, I feel I'm constantly getting spammed with random BS, like triple-reds and blue shells every race. (Note: Mario Kart Wii is one of my favorite video games of all time, so it's really hard to criticize this.)

Mario Kart 7: Removes so much of what Wii introduced (bikes, great characters, single-player VS). 

Mario Kart 8/Mario Kart 8 Deluxe: Brings back the coin as an item. Introduces some characters that shouldn't even be separate characters (looking at you Metal/Gold Mario, Tanooki Mario, Pink Gold Peach, Cat Peach, all 7 Koopalings, and all the babies). Brings back bikes, but removes true inside drift in favor of ""hybrid"" drifting. Also, fire hopping (only applies to MK8).

Mario Kart Tour: While I've given ""complaints"" about every other Mario Kart game, they've all been pretty much just petty excuses to complain about them, and they don't really detract from the gameplay (in fact, some of them make the games better). This isn't the case with Mario Kart Tour. I could write a 5-page essay on everything wrong with this. The game probably shouldn't have been made. While the game is free-to-play, you need to pay in order to get more of the in-game currency needed to unlock characters (a standard with mobile games). You need to pay a MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION for things like early access to multiplayer and 200CC.  At least with the other games, when you bought the game, you owned the whole game. I wouldn't have minded if the game was $20-30 to download, with no other in-app purchases necessary, or even if Nintendo did what they did with Super Mario Run, and have the free version basically just be a demo and the rest of the game was a one-time payment of $10. Also, the controls are absolutely terrible. Mario Kart belongs being played with a real controller, analog stick or D-pad.",mariokart

Track count per game: SNES (2), N64 (1), GBA (2), GCN (2), DS (1), Wii (2), 3DS (3), Wii U (3)

My interest in Mario Kart was recently rekindled, on the one hand, by all the talk about Mario Kart Tour and, on the other hand, by Scott the Woz's recent video on Mario Kart Wii. I then came to question the future of the series, as in feeling an urge to speculate about the inevitable next Mario Kart (which I will refer to as MK9 for the sake of convenience). Since MK8 Deluxe came out well over 2 years ago as I'm writing this, I think it's reasonable to expect Nintendo to release a brand new Mario Kart game for the Switch in the near future, since each iteration of the franchise has sold very well for every console it came out on. Not to mention Mario Kart Tour's recent success, which seems to have sparked even greater interest in the franchise among the general public. By the way, I think that a potential splitting of the consumer base between MK8 Deluxe and the hypothetical new game wouldn't be much of a problem, if even at all, since MK8 Deluxe's sales have been confirmed to reach over 19 million units in October 2019.

This brought me back to the pre-MK8 days, when I discovered a fascination with watching random prediction videos for retro tracks. And this is what I'm about to do right now but for MK9, assuming that the base game retains the 8-cup/32-track format and doesn't remake previously remade tracks.

Since I seem to have an uncanny desire to analyze patterns, this is where I should start. 

First off, we know for a fact that since MK7, the last track of the Lightning Cup has always been a Rainbow Road, the different iterations of which were added by chronological order (SNES in MK7 and N64 in MK8). It's pretty safe to say, then, that MKSC's Rainbow Road is next in line.

This brings me to a couple patterns that are less obvious until you look in-depth into some choices that were made in past games. DISCLAIMER: I may talk about these trends as if they were the laws of physics, but the fact that they exist doesn't necessarily mean that the precedent they seem to have been setting will be followed in MK9.  

The first one consists in bringing back the final Star Cup track from 2 games prior as the second-to-last Lightning Cup track (GCN DK Mountain in MkWii, DS Airship Fortress in MK7 and Wii Grumble Volcano in MK8), which would give us MK7's Maka Wuhu in MK9. The second one is harder to spot, as it switches between even-numbered and odd-numbered mainline Mario Kart games. The former kick off their Shell Cups with the second Mushroom Cup track from two games prior. The latter, that we're interested in here, open their Shell Cups with the oldest available first track (SNES Mario Circuit 1 in MKDS and N64 Luigi Raceway in MK7), which would give us MKDS's Figure-8 Circuit in MK9. This would be because GBA Peach Circuit and GCN Luigi Circuit have already been remade in MKDS. 

If still followed in the future, these patterns would then exclude, respectively, MK8's Mount Wario and Water Park from MK9's selection of retro tracks, and they would be saved for the inevitable MK10 (whenever that one comes out).

Now, assuming that re-remakes of tracks won't be a thing in MK9's base game, we know for a fact that MK64 only has one unused track left: Wario Stadium. Seeing it remade in MK9 seems borderline inevitable to me.

Another game that is running short on remaining tracks is Double Dash, with only 4 tracks left. 2 of them seem unlikely to me, as MKSC's Rainbow Road would probably be prioritized and Wario Colosseum's overall motif is similar to that of MK64's Wario Stadium. As for MKDD's other 2 remaining tracks (Mushroom City and Bowser's Castle), I think that if from MK9 onward, base games remain restricted to 16 previously-unremade retro tracks, they will both be remade in this game in order to make space for the inevitability of MK9's (and subsequent games') tracks having to be brought back. 

As for most of the remaining tracks (SNES Choco Island 1, SNES Vanilla Lake 1, GBA Cheep Cheep Island, Wii Toad's Factory, Wii Dry Dry Ruins, 3DS Mario Circuit and 3DS Wario Shipyard), I took 3 factors into account. Thematical variety (keeping in mind that a snow/ice track, a beach track and a Mario Circuit have always been remade in each game prior, and that a desert track has frequently been remade as well), how they could benefit from the new mechanics that have been introduced since their base game initially came out, and their potential for a graphical overhaul. I would also bring up the fun factor, but this is purely subjective. 

Lastly, since MK9 will logically be the first game that brings back MK8 tracks, the 3 tracks that I chose (Twisted Mansion, Electrodrome and Cloudtop Cruise) are practically complete guesses and are the first ones I would expect to be proven wrong.

TLDR (if you actually lasted this long paying attention to a random online dude writing about retro tracks in Mario Kart as if it was his master's thesis, in which case, you deserve respect and then some): I'd be very surprised if GBA Rainbow Road, 3DS Maka Wuhu, DS Figure-8 Circuit N64 Wario Stadium, GCN Mushroom City and GCN Bowser's Castle aren't in MK9. The remaining 10 tracks range from educated guesses to shots in the dark. 

I'm curious to comment on this post when MK9 eventually comes out in order to see what I got right and wrong...",mariokart

[MKT] sub worth it?,"At 4.99 it's not a bad price, but I just don't know if the items are necessarily worth it. I don't even use the 200cc option, except this tour for the win 3 races at 200cc achievement 🤷‍♂️",mariokart
[MKT] The bundle prices are ridiculous,"So in MKT you can buy a bundle for 40€ which gives you Donkey Kong and 90 Rubies, which allow you to fire the pipe 20 times. So for 40€ you get one specific character and the chance to get 20 more items, which can be High-End but more probably will be Normal and repeated.

Now for that same price (or even lower), you can buy other games. For example, Crash Team Racing Nitro Fueled, which is a full kart game (and IMO a remake of the best kart game ever), with more than 40 characters and 35 tracks, full kart customisation, lots of different game modes, and which is still getting free content every month.

It just baffles me how Nintendo can charge so much for something that has so little value.",mariokart
[MKT] 2 free weeks of Gold Pass every 3 tours!,"This is a copy-paste of a comment I made in another thread which asked if the Gold Pass was worth it:

This tour, I got 32 rubies from the gift boxs that are only for Gold Pass subs. That's 32 rubies for 5.49€ (I'm from Europe). The Ruby bundle in the shop with the closest price is 6.99€ for 10 Rubies. 1.50€ more for 22 less Rubies. 

But wait, there's more! Not only did I get 32 more Rubies, but also one guaranteed High-End character and kart, and multiple level-up tickets which are exclusive to the Gold Pass. These rewards allow me to complete Ruby Challenge Cards faster, thus earning even more Rubies.

BUT WAIT!

I'm only talking about one tour, which is 2 weeks, but the Gold Pass lasts one entire month. So you should multiple everything I said by 2... Or even 3! As I subscribed to the gold pass the last day of the Tokyo Tour, I got all the rewards for that tour but it also means that I have one more month of Gold Pass, which equals to the next two tours as well. In fact, I could get all the Gold Pass rewards for the Paris tour and then cancel my Gold Pass right before the tour ends, before it renews automatically. Then, the very last day of the following Tour (so two weeks later), I can just sub again to the Gold Pass which again virtually grants me 3 Tours of rewards.

This means that if you're clever, you can get 2 free weeks of Gold Pass every 3 tours.",mariokart

"[MK] What if Mario Kart 9 will be like Double Dash, but with 3 characters per Kart?","In case you don't know, Double Dash has a pretty strong fan base albeit not as strong as Mario Kart Wii.  However, what if Mario Kart 9 will be like Double Dash but with THREE characters per Kart?  Lets call it: MARIO KART TRIPLE DASH!

Here's how I think it would go: one person drives and the other two shoot and they rotate in a clockwise.  Since its a popular trend with Mario Kart, it's possible that kart combinations and anti gravity would come back.  I think karts would share a common trend of having a narrow front and a much wider back.  Gliders would be detached in the space between the two back characters.

In terms of characters, its clear that Petey Piranha would come back since he made his racing debut in Double Dash.  Inklings might come back since they debuted in MK8DX and maybe they'd add more characters like the Squid Sisters and Off the Hook.  One thing they might do is allow multi colored characters to be on the same Kart because MK8DX had like 40 racers so putting 3 characters per kart and 12 places would be like using over 90% of the cast for just one race so they might lower it back to 8 or even 4.  Special items could come back.  They might eliminate hopping since Double Dast did drifting differently.",mariokart

So I've come up with a rework that I think may make the Blue Shell more beneficial for the player who gets the item, and also less of an annoyance for the player who is hit by it. Some may disagree with me on this, so I'd appreciate some constructive criticism.

So my idea goes like this: The Blue Shell can only be obtained by players from 10th to 12th place, and is the rarest item in the game. When fired, it travels along the ground just like it does in MK7 and MK8. However, instead of just going for 1st, the blue shell actively homes in on every player on it's way to first reaching first. (This means, if you are in 11th and fired a Blue Shell, it will target 10th-1st).

When targeting players en route to 1st, it will home in on them like a red shell, however it will not be as ruthless. Players who are too far offroad or who are being retrieved by Lakitu will not be targeted. Racers with power items like stars will not be affected. Once a racer is hit by the shell, they will spin out, similar to getting hit by a banana (rather than flipping the racers like it does currently), so the affect is minimal. The shell will still cause an explosion and flip first place like it usually does.

This rework means the person who gets the item actually has a chance to catch up with it the other racers. Lower ranked players are less vulnerable to the shell as they will more likely have power items. Also the person in 1st place won't lose as much of a lead due to 2nd onwards also spinning out briefly.

Thanks for reading, tell me what you think of the idea.",mariokart

[MKT] What is a 1x bonus-points boost?,"Aside from the obvious mathematical problem of how one multiplied by anything could give you more... What does ""bonus-points"" even mean? The game is very unclear about where this stat goes.

If you're not sure what I'm talking about look at the levels for any car or glider and it's say ""+15% to combo time and 1x bonus-points boost.""

I've worked out that ""combo time"" extends the 2sec default you get between collecting a coin or doing an action but the 1x bonus-points is very unclear. Anyone care to explain?

I'm trying to decide if it's worth using a high-end level up ticket to win the weekly rankings or if I should just save it.",mariokart
"[MK8DX] If there's a Mario Kart 9 for Switch, it should be as an expansion pack for 8 Deluxe","That way we could keep old characters and stages (If they made a new game, let's be honest they're not going to port Isabelle over again)  


And it wouldn't split the community between the two games....   


Plus since they have so much of the base cast in the game already, it could give them a chance to really go crazy with the characters, fan requests like Diddy Kong, Funky Kong, Kamek, and Birdo, characters we haven't seen in ages like Petey Piranha, Donkey Kong Jr., Paratroopa, and ROB. Maybe port some from MKT (like Luigi's Mansion King Boo, Pauline, and Musician Mario)",mariokart

[MKT] Rewards for the Gold Pass...,"For those of you who currently have, or at one point had, the Gold Pass for Mario Kart Tour, if one gets the free trial and cancels before it expires, do you keep everything you earned that’s normally hidden behind the paywall, or do they re-lock the items behind the paywall and you’re incapable of playing those things unless you buy the Gold Pass again? I know there are some services like that and was wondering if MKT was similar, though I assumed it wasn’t.",mariokart

"[MKT] Hidden attributes such as Speed, Accel, Weight?","Mario Kart has joined the premium game craze, and I'm getting a feeling that most of us aren't spending any money on the app. That's good! There's not a shortage of freebies, and those who do pay extra face some of the same limitations. You can't endlessly upgrade items' XP, and a most of the cups aren't even built yet.


But whenever I look online for any kind of discussion about MKT, it's usually about the perks of each driver, kart, and item. Those perks being base points, special power ups, favored courses, etc. However, you never see anything about speed or drifts or anything relative to winning the race. Apparently, weight classes aren't a thing....and all drivers and kart drive just as fast as each other. But I'm starting to notice that might not be true. Certain characters and karts that appear bigger seem to be the slowest, clumsiest, and ironically the weakest.


My prime example is that when I use High End King Boo from LM, he gets affected by every hit and takes way too long to recover. It's gotten worse ever since the Halloween promo ended. I specifically use him for his base points, however he can get bumped down to the bottom 4 of a race if he's hit by too many thing. However, the characters you wouldn't use, such as the ""Normal"" lighter ones? Baby Daisy, Baby Peach, Shy Guy for examples? They're trying to win. 



I really wish we can exchange items for rubies. I hate Boss King Boo rn, and certain gliders are pretty useless to me. Same with karts. If I'm NEVER going to get a blooper, if I never do a slipstream, and if I don't even want a coin from an item box.....why would I need anything to give said instances a boost?

Even if we have to exchange them for coins or item tickets, please take these worthless items off my hands so I can get something I actually want.

I wish there was an option for turning off items in Grand Prix mode [Mario Kart],"I love mario kart as a game, the characters, the maps, and the mechanics, and I love trying to get the best rating in all of the cups, but damn, are the items really annoying. I could be chilling in first place, 10 coins, 3 bananas, but then some fuckhead AI in 7th place drops a blue shell, and there's a literal 1:1000000 chance I'll dodge it, and boom, i'm in third, I end up 2nd place at the end, and I have to start over if I wanna get A rank, or 3 stars, or whatever. like, wtf? I know it's the whole spirit of Mario Kart, but like, c'mon, that isn't fun, re-doing courses I've done a million times over just to have the exact same thing happen 2 races in? Wack. And about 50% of the weapons, aren't even controlled, I love green shells, bananas and bombs, those are items that take skill and effort, and I love that. But lightning bolts, red shells, and some items that just speed you ahead with no drawback? that sucks ass, I don't want items to be removed (Obviously), but I honestly really want a way to turn them off in single player matches. I know everyone is gonna bring up the ""That's the point of Mario Kart"" but look man, I'm trying to get the best rating on the hardest difficulty, I don't want to have to deal with some shitty luck deciding if I win or if I get sent back to the level select screen.

[MKT] I have yet to get a legendary character from the warp pipe,"I think Nintendo needs to rethink their strategy on this one. I had the Gold Pass for the last two months, beat every cup, received every present, and completed every challenge possible so far.

I think it’s an insult towards the player saying that if you are buying the game, you leave it all up to chance if you get the special characters or not.

I know that’s how most mobile games are and I’m not too into them in the first place, but I always thought Nintendo was better than that.

Also, I know I paid for the membership knowing it would be up to chance, so I’m the fool for paying, but I’m still having fun with the game and I am paying to get the special characters that happen to be in presents sometimes only if you are a gold pass member. I just think having 100 chances on the warp pipe and constantly getting that stupid parachute glider is absurd.",mariokart

[MK8DX] Make a Pro Wheel Controller Nintendo,"Before anyone says it, yes I heard that using a normal control is better, and no, I have no intentions to ever stop using a wheel. I love the wheel and have been using it ever since Mario Kart Wii. 

The thing is, the switch joycon wheels are too small. They cramp my hands and make it difficult to drive. I appreciate that I can still use a wheel Nintendo, but can we have more options on size? There is definitely a market for this, it appears to be a common complaint. If Nintendo were to release a Pro Wheel Controller-essentially dedicated for Mario Kart, but still technically usable with other games-I would shell out for one in a heart beat. 

What do you other wheel users think about that? Would you also be willing to spend $50-60 on a Pro Controller shaped like a wheel, about the size of the Wii wheels? Is there truly a market for this or are we doomed to rely on options like third party larger plastic wheel shells or labo?",mariokart

[MKT] Super Fissapointed with Mario Kart Tour,"Since launch, I've always had high hopes for Mario Kart Tour. Sure it wasn't the new Mario Kart that I had wanted after playing Mario Kart 8's tracks over 10,000 times each in the past 6 years, but it was at least something. 

However in the past few tours the game has become increasingly dissapointing. We've gone from having newcomers like Pauline and returnees like Diddy Kong to having constant costumes of Mario and Peach and now a Black Shy Guy? Really? And that's just the characters, the karts have become increasingly boring as well, all just being reskins of the same karts already in the game. In this upcoming tour we're getting our third Mushmellow, that's ridiculous. And then the High End is the Radish Kart just a reskin of the Carrot Kart. The gliders are no exception either in this case.

Perhaps the most dissapointing thing though is the lack of tracks. Sure I wasn't expecting a ton of brand new ones, bit I was at least expecting a pretty consistent amount of retro ones per Tour. However with each tour that simply hasn't been the case. When the game launched with the New York Tour we got 11 new tracks, then in the Tokyo Tour we got 7 new tracks, then in the Halloween Tour we got 3 new tracks, and recently in the Paris Tour we've gotten only 2 new tracks, and it looks like for the Winter Tour the only new track we'll be getting is DK Pass with them just adding Christmas trees to returning tracks.

I'm not saying I want 11 or even 7 tracks for every tour since that may be asking a bit much, though I don't think it is considering how much money they've made off of this game, but at least 5 per tour would be good and manageable. Just 1 track just isn't enough new content, especially when for the characters and karts you're just having reskins of character and karts already in the game.",mariokart

[MK8D] Retro Course Music Idea,"I recently bought myself a Switch and a copy of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, I'm absolutely loving it so far but there's one thing that kinda bugs me, and that's the lack of the original music for tracks from previous Mario Kart games.

All of the retro tracks I've played so far (I still haven't played a few) have music that has been refreshed to fit with MK8's futuristic theme, at least that's how I'm interpreting it. And while some of this music is quite good (Tick Rock Clock's refresh is extremely good imo), I still prefer the original versions most of the time.

A few examples of this are DS Wario Stadium (or Waluigi Pinball), SNES Rainbow Road and Wii Wario's Goldmine, the updated music can sound significantly different from the original version. Now whether or not you like these tracks is up to you, I personally think they're fine but I prefer the originals, at least in those three cases.

That leads me to the purpose of this post, I was wondering if you guys think a retro music option would be a good idea, an optional downloadable sound pack that brings back the original music for retro courses.",mariokart
Something that's always bothered me,[removed],mariokart
[MK] Something that's always bothered me,"This isn't that big of an issue, but it is a pet peeve of mine: when you finish a race against CPU players, their final placements are based on where they are when YOU finish, not their actual finishing placement. Like if you finish in first, whoever's in second at the time is locked into second place even if they fall behind before crossing the finish line. Not sure if that's also the case in other racing games, but I don't like it.",mariokart

[Mkt] everything devalued,"Disclaimer sometimes I'm to much of a conspiracy theorist.

So the recent changes to mkt in a lot of eyes have been terrible, some don't care. But I think the changes have the potential to completely ruin  the game, and I don't mean our enjoyment, I mean even Nintendos pockets. Which they certainly do not want.

So bare with me a moment. They have recently started limiting what char6, and items come I to the shop. Which basically needs coins as a whole. But I don't think they foresee what their greed could potentially do, nerfing coins ruins everything. 

-thers is now no reason to really save coins.
--without coins theres nothing to try to grind except points and rubies.

- but why grind points or rubies when the only point is to get characters who the best of only give us a ton more coins

-also devaluing  characters.

So my point is devaluing coins devalues  everything  else, which would make interest in the game serious wane. U less they really wanted to balance how highly valued coin box chars were to",mariokart

[Mario Kart Double Dash] How to know if the controller is not broken?,"Hello everyone. 

A friend of mine bought a Game Cube and Mario Kart DD.

We have a lot of fun but I did had trouble with some of his controllers and thought I will buy one for me so if it's going broken it will be my fault and that's it.

So here I am with my new received controller and I tested it on my PC with Dolphin, and I'm still find some things odd.

I have trouble getting dash when I'm going on the left, for exemple on the Luigi Circuit where there is a lot of left turn. Also I find sometime to have the release of my R trigger when I do not wanted it.

So how to know if it's me who is bad at the game, or if the controller have a problem? I find really hard to have consistent dash on left on every controller but I can do right one pretty decently.

Is there a game to launch with specific need (I launched Smash Bros to test the [Snapback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDIswmtOeKw), and fortunately I don't have it)

Can I dissassembled it and see things? (I will do it if I keep this one because the control sticks aren't clean like shown on this [picture](https://imgur.com/undefined))

I hope this is the best sub to post it, but since it's to mostly play Mario Kart on the Game Cube of my friend, I was thinking it was :)

Mario Kart 9 ideas,"Many of you fans can agree with me on this as you wish. No hating or anything

In my opinion, MKW is my top pick just for its gameplay. It's fast, hectic, random and requires a lot of skill to play (skill that I no longer have) mixed in with Wiimmfi or CTGP, you have an easy 8-10/10.",mariokart
Traction is Useless in [MK8DX],"There are some classes in MK8DX where the only thing a character has over another class is one point higher in traction such as Mario class.  However, research reveals that traction has very little if any use.  In game statistics reveal that traction on road has no change no matter how high the stat is while higher traction does yield better brake and slipping ability off road, that concept is almost never needed or used and as such, classes such as the Mario class are overshadowed by the Luigi class due to said class having higher handling in all terrains

[MK] Which MK game do you find the hardest (against CPU)?,"My housemate and I are doing a challenge to get first in every single cup on the hardest difficulty in each mario kart game (that we own).

Mario Kart: Super Circuit (Gameboy Player on GC ftw!) is hella hard. We only play for about 30 mins a night and we‘ve been stuck on the Special Cup for about a week. Yesterday I almost killed myself (not literally) when I rounded the final turn with a mushroom for the win and flew off the edge.

[MKDS] How do you feel the GameCube retro tracks were handled in this game?,"Considering that the DS is drastically weaker than the GameCube, it's kind of odd to even see the newer tracks on the older hardware. Odd, yet interesting to me. The five courses we have are:  
Luigi Circuit  
Baby Park  
Mushroom Bridge  
Yoshi Circuit  
Pipe Plaza (Battle)

Of the race tracks, I think the only one to not have drastically suffered is Luigi Circuit. I think the side boosts are missing (it's been a while since I've played), but the rest of the course is still intact. Even the Chain Chomp is still there; I assume a reused asset from Peach Gardens.

Baby Park is downgraded in every way. For one, the lap reduction? I don't even understand why it was reduced from 7 to 5. Second, the lack of chaotic items in DS, while better for most of the game, makes Baby Park more bland to drive in. The visuals don't help. I get that the DS was weaker, but the lack of stuff happening in the background makes the course feel dead. I don't know what could've been done to fix to problem.

Mushroom Bridge lost a lot from Double Dash. Most of the unique vehicles are gone (I think most of them now come from Shroom Ridge), I think one of the shortcuts is missing, and you can no longer drive on the bridge. I don't understand the last choice. Would the DS really have started lagging if one were able to drive on top of the bridge?

Yoshi Circuit isn't too bad, but I must say, I'm not a fan of the 2D Piranha Plants. The game has 3D versions of them in Mario Circuit (DS), so I don't know why those weren't used here. The shortcut is also missing.

Pipe Plaza has almost no difference. Makes sense, considering the arena is so small.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Overall, I like that DS was ambitious enough to implement these more tracks, but the limitations of the hardware really come through. In terms of what I would've picked for the GameCube content, I would've only changed two courses:

Luigi Circuit - It's an iconic track, and the DS would have very little issue with it.

Daisy Cruiser - I'd argue this is another iconic track, even more so than Yoshi Circuit.

Baby Park - Despite the flaws in how it was executed in the final product, it's great for short matches. The laps would remain 7.

Mushroom City - This is just a more visually-interesting version of Mushroom Bridge, and is harder than Yoshi Circuit, so more fitting for the Lightning Cup.

Pipe Plaza - You can't go wrong with it.

An idea for MK9 [MK],"And before you leave a response about MKT, I know it exists. Also, this was originally a YouTube comment.



**Overview**

MK9 is going to crank up the fun even further. With an awesome selection of tracks, a good deal of new ones, and a nice set of karts, bikes and ATVs, get ready to race.


**Gimmicks**

MK9 will keep the rocket start, drafting, spin-boost, ultra-mini turbos, trick ramps, boost ramps, and glide ramps, as well as anti-gravity.


**Art Style**

MK9 will go by MK8DX's realism, but add minimal cel shaders instead of shadows.


**Characters**

MK9 will mostly copy MK8DX's lineup, but drop Tanooki Mario, Cat Peach, and all non-Mario characters. It will also add Diddy Kong, Hammer Bro (with Fire and Boomerang as alts), King Bob-omb, Kamek, Petey Piranha and Boom Boom (with Pom Pom).


**Vehicles**

Anything not Mario is dropped, save the Blue Falcon. The number of parts is cut down on as well, reducing it to a few iconic vehicles, wheels and gliders, all with unique stat modifiers. (Nothing specific here because I don't want to sift through immense numbers of parts.)




**GRAND PRIX**

The speeds to choose from are 50cc, 100cc, 150cc and 200cc, with Reverse as a modifier. Cups are split into Nitro, Retro, and Super.


**Nitro Tracks**


Mushroom Cup:

Super Mario Circuit, which is a track scattered with Mario memorabilia.

Peach's Castle, in which you drive up, down, and all around the castle.

Luigi's Mansion, which takes you from the entrance to the basement to the rooftop, then down onto the grounds.

Toad Town, a scenic town on a cliff with a market and park.


Flower Cup:

Mushroom Port, a bustling shipping area filled with shipping crates and forklifts.

Freezie Glacier, an ice-cold and slippery track in the middle of winter.

Bowser Oil, an oil field and refinery for Bowser's karting enterprises.

Mario Kart HQ, a circuit that takes you through the brain of Mario Kart.


Star Cup:

Starman Space, a space center that features a rocket blasting off.

Comet Observatory, a tour around the Comet Observatory and surrounding area.

Koopa City, a bustling city filled to the brim with Toads, Koopas and Shy Guys of all kinds.

Toad Services, a busy servicing garage and neighboring businesses.


Special Cup:

MKTV Arena, a stadium filled with all manner of death-defying stunts.

Dry-Bone Bazaar, an undead market and crypt.

Bowser's Castle, now with giant walking Bowser Statues and a very deep pit.

Rainbow Road, running from Peach's Castle, to orbit, to the Comet Observatory, then into the galaxy, sporting a golden finish and gold finish line, covered in rainbows as always. (4 segment race)




**Retro Tracks**


Shell Cup:

DS Cheep Cheep Beach

GCN Daisy Cruiser

3DS Wuhu Loop

N64 Choco Mountain


Banana Cup:

Wii Maple Treeway

GCN DK Mountain

N64 Royal Raceway

3DS Music Park


Leaf Cup:

SNES Choco Island 2

3DS Neo Bowser City

Wii U Mount Wario


Lightning Cup:

Wii U Electrodrome

N64 DK's Jungle Parkway

N64 Toad's Turnpike

N64 Rainbow Road


**SUPER CUPS**


Nitro Cup:

All Nitro Cups, back to back. CPU gets progressively harder. Remixes of the track themes included.


Retro Cup:

All Retro Cups, back to back. CPU gets progressively harder. Remixed remixes.


Bowser Cup:

All* Bowser's Castle tracks, back to back. CPU gets harder, remixed themes.

(* Only Bowser's Castle 4 for GBA)


Rainbow Cup:

A marathon of all Rainbow Roads, back to back. CPU is set to Medium, and jam out to crazy remixes of all the Rainbow Roads.


Completing all of the cups will give you a bronze, silver, gold or platinum crown on your Mii, depending on engine speed.




**BATTLE MODE**

MK9's Battle mode takes all of MK8's modes, and introduces a new way to play Balloon Battle/Bob-omb Blast. Survival is a modifier that makes it last man driving, with you only having one set of balloons.",mariokart

[MKT] Mario Kart Tour is NOT Mario Kart 9... here’s why,"I’ve seen several people claiming that Mario Kart Tour is the 9th game in the series, so the next mainline entry will be Mario Kart 10. Now we could easily brush this off by saying, “It’s a spinoff, so it doesn’t count in the mainline titles”, but let’s say they don’t believe it’s a spinoff. 

Here’s the nail in the coffin: Mario Party 10, for example, isn’t the 10th game. Actually it’s the 13th. So why is it called Mario Party ‘10’? Because the handheld titles were considered spin offs. 

Now tell me why a mobile entry would count as a mainline mario kart game, but a mario party for nintendo’s own handhelds wouldn’t?",mariokart

[MK] Mario Kart 9 aka Brand new Mario Kart for the switch petition,"

I know it's a long shot and honestly idk if this will even help but i did give some good data/information to at least help a Nintendo rep see that we need something new and not a port of an old game that's over 5 years old at this point.

[MK] Mario Kart 9 Concept: Teams,"**The Main Idea**

Mario Kart 9's main concept is to rework teams. Teams in previous games didn't feel like teams—it just felt racing with the point system completely out of control. But what if there was a way to play in teams, but with collaboration between players? And teams feel like you are all working together, for both single- and multiplayer?

Team races, in Mario Kart 9, now have more ways to interact with your team, including a combined coin cache and items that can become better—or worse—depending on your teammates. This is, in a way, a reincarnation of Double Dash, just adapted for newer audiences.

In vs., there are choices for playing normally (no teams), two teams, three, four, and six. However, Grand Prix will offer only two modes (instead of the average one): ""Classic"" and ""Teams"". Classic is when there is no teams, while teams has four teams of three. After a trophy (at least third) is unlocked for each cup doubles, quadruples, and sextuples are offered for that cc. Grand Prix modes start with 50cc, 100cc, 150cc, and 200cc. When 150cc is beat (gold trophies), mirror is unlocked. When 200cc is beat, reverse (200cc version) is unlocked.

**Teams**

Teams are, typically, split up in threes. Keeping with the team mode from previous games, there are combined point values (when 1st, 11th, and 12th are achieved, 18 points are rewarded to that team for that round). 

During a race, a driver can only hold one item. However, the player can see the rest of the team's items in corresponding circles surrounding the driver's item in the top-right corner of the screen. Each teammates' place can also be seen next to the number. 

The team has one big cache of coins, with a max of 10 multiplied by the number of players on each team. 

**Items, or more specifically, how they work**

A driver can only hold one item. However, if a teammate's item is on the ground, they can be picked up by the driver if they have no item (alike to the heart in double dash). This includes shells thrown at teammates, bananas, and even stars. While any driver can pick up stars off the ground and other auto-use items like mushrooms or bullet bills, only teammates can hold them in their inventory for future use\*. Each team has a corresponding color which can be seen both in the circle surrounding the item(s) in the top left corner of the screen and in small aura like in previous games 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think of the idea? Each new Mario Kart has to bring something new to the series, and as the evolution from MK8DX to MK9 will have practically no change in graphics, something new and marketable must be introduced (like fun team racing). Any thoughts?

\*Should other teams be able to pick up your team's items like described at all? I'm still stuck on that.",mariokart

Why is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe the only Nintendo Switch title (for me at least) that never lags online?,"I play on my Switch quite often, and one of my favorite game franchises of all time is Mario Kart. Naturally I play the online as it is really fun to try and go on a long 1st placing winning streak. I never lag during any race creating a really smooth experience. But other games, such as Smash Bros Ultimate for example, will lag horrifically when you play online. I know that Nintendo doesn't dedicate online their own servers, but what is the difference between Mario Kart vs Smash Bros/Mario Maker, etc?

[MK] How would you build your ideal Mario Kart?,"Here are some ideas that I'd love to see implemented in one way or another, but I don't really see many of these in the near future.

|Idea|Likeliness|Reason|
:-:|:-:|:-:
|Bring back MKWii's Blue Shell|Highly unlikely|[MKWii's Blue Shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTc6sa3BFY) had a few attributes I preferred over its successors. First, the knockback was much more punishing than in MK8. But most importantly, starting [from Mario Kart 7](https://youtu.be/cL7V0iTBN24?t=36), the Blue Shell looks odd, and they actually made it worse [in MK8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arLqrQuGAvk). It looks kinda robotic whereas the MKWii one looks fluid and alive which is quite charming.|
|Reverse course instead of Mirror|Unlikely|Mirror maps were interesting and confusing at first, but since they've been a staple of the series for so long, it's not hard to see them as just another 150cc maps. My idea is that instead of playing Mirror maps, you play the same maps backwards (with some map tweaks) so they feel fresh and you can see them from a new perspective.|
|Stat sort|Likely|I hate scrolling through kart parts, and not knowing which items have better specific stats than others until I select them, and even then I can't compare their stats directly.|
|Free spectator camera|Unlikely|Anti-gravity is a cool mechanic, but without a free spectator camera, it is hard to picture how the courses loop around and fit within their world.|
|Lap options|Likely|I remember this thing being available back on Double Dash, but hasn't returned since. Being able to play more laps in a single course would be cool, particularly for cool courses like N64 Rainbow Road where there's a single lap and it was turned from one of the longest courses, to one of the shortest.|
|Baby Rosalina out|Unlikely|The fact that Baby Rosalina is the embodiment of everything that is not canon annoys me so much.|
|Koopalings together with pallet swaps|Somewhat unlikely|Something similar as what happens in Smash. I feel like not many people like them as to fill that many slots.|
|Justice for Kamek|Likely|We all like Kamek tho, and the fact that he hasn't been in a single Mario Kart is sad.|
|Cool tricks back|Highly unlikely|Why did they decide to get rid of MKWii's tricks? They were amazing, and much more fun than following entries.|
|MKWii SR system|Unlikely|I think this system is fairer than the one in place in MK7 and 8. Starting from the middle and having a chance to actually drop is good to keep bad players competing with each other, while more competitive players can race each others without stomping on bad players.|
|Blue Shell counter that requires skill|Unlikely|I don't really like the Horn. I'd rather have a similarly rare item with which you can avoid (not destroy) the shell if you time it perfectly. We already have that with shrooms, but we can't give shrooms to the first player, so I think a different item should do. I think an item that stops you in place instantly for as long as you press the button and makes the shell explode just ahead if you time it correctly would be nice.|
|GBA Rainbow Road|Highly likely|I loved that track.|
|Training mode|Likely|It would be nice to have a training mode for players to train advanced skills such as Blue Shell counter, shortcuts, item management, Green Shell aim, etc.|",mariokart
[MK8DX] New way to dodge blue shells.,"This was on accident just as a heads up. I was in first place doing my thing with Donkey Kong moped and I saw the dreaded blue shell. I started dragging my green shell behind me just because. I don't know if it was a drift boost or an acceleration pad, but when it began it's descent I sped up and it collided with the green shell I was dragging. No explosion or anything. They both just shattered and I kept on driving.

I constantly finish 2nd and 3rd because I have no way of catching up. Is there something I’m missing or what?",mariokart
"In my opinion, [MKDD] has the weakest offroad mechanics","The game doesn't punish you as much for going off-road compared to other games in the series. At most its like a 25-30% drop in speed, compared to mkwii having a much higher penalty (60-70%) for mushroom-less off-roading. This can cause some problems, as I am hardwired to so certain shortcuts, even without a mushroom because the drop in speed is negligible.",mariokart

[MK] Some general questions about Mario Kart (especially MKWii),"I'm by no means a newcomer to Mario Kart, but I would like to ask some questions about specific stuff related to the series (especially MKWii, being the game listed in the ta).

1. When it comes to advanced gameplay, why is it that trapping (placing bananas on specific areas to mess up lines) tends to always be talked about with Wii, but not with any other game in the series? Is it because it also tends to also involve placing traps in areas to block shortcuts, and large shortcuts are a novelty in MK8D?
2. When referring to shocks, why is it that people refer to it as ""the"" shock and not just ""shock"" or ""a shock?"" Presumably the explanation I'm expecting is in MKWii, only one can be in play, but even when playing a more modern Mario Kart game, where more than one shock can be in play, players will still refer to it as ""the"" shock. Is it mostly a case of force of habit?

"[Mario Kart Tour] is almost here, so now is a good time to recount your premature thoughts on the game.","Because when else will that be crystal clear?

Taken as a spinoff from Mario Kart rather than a new main entry (which would just be jarring if that were the case), this is shaping up to be at least an intriguing game. I have played mobile games before, and while this feels pretty sluggish compared to other racing games on the platforms, it still has a sort of charm that makes up for it. Part of it comes from its slight twists like missions thrown into cups of constantly rotating courses and barrel variants of items along with other general gameplay tweaks. Not to mention its slick visual style. Had most of this already existed in Mario Kart, I honestly might have heeded little attention of the outing. But this is something new for the series on multiple levels, so this could be a decent thing to try. But I am not spending money on microtransactions for sure.

Will it be successful for Nintendo? Not sure. Probably not too big regarding the microtransactions, though, given the generally negative reception of the beta. (Even given what was fixed, some people are just going to ignore it regardless because of the bad press and any worrisome details that do stay in.) Basically, it should eclipse Super Mario Run but probably not hit the levels of Fire Emblem.

MKDD’s bananas are shown as whole bananas when held and actually peel into shape when thrown; heck, the bananas even follow the trajectory line in which they were thrown, while pointing in the direction of the line.
Now my question is: What do you guys think of MKDD’s item animations and how can you compare them to newer Mario Kart games?",mariokart

Then there's the new changes that somehow made the game worse. If my memory is correct, 200cc was freely unlocked but there was stamina (which I somewhat prefer over this stupid paywall) and so many more characters were available, too. Luigi, King Boo, Rosalina, Waluigi, and even the Koopalings are just gone and that is so infuriating because they were all fun to have and collect and use and now they're all removed. It's so stupid. And grand star prizes seem nonexistent now so it's harder to get characters. Also you can lose exp? Who thought that's a good idea?

The beta was so much better and actually fun, and now I'm really frustrated with this game and don't want to play any more. Might as well play Deluxe on the Switch. Nintendo... why?",mariokart

[MK] What's your least favourite track from each Mario Kart game?,"Self-explanatory title. Every MK game has that one track that just pisses you off. And I'm not including remakes from retro tracks included in later games. 

**Super Mario Kart:** Either *Choco Island 2* or *Vanilla Lake 2*. Both can be equally frustrating for me. 

**Mario Kart 64**: Tough one. I don't have any track I actually dislike in this game due to my enormous nostalgia for it. It was my first ever MK and this game was awesome back in the day. But I'm gonna go with *Sherbet Land*. I've bumped into those penguins A LOT when I was a kid and also fell into the cold water too many times to count. 

**Super Circuit**: This game is frustrating as hell, so there's a lot of candidates for this one, but my vote goes to *Lakeside Park*. Seriously, \*\*\*\* this track. 

**Double Dash!!**: Perhaps this is an unpopular opinion, but I cannot stand *Baby Park*. 

**DS**: *Waluigi Pin*... haha gotcha! J/k. I love Waluigi Pinball, man! In all seriousness now, my least favourite track from this game is *Peach Gardens,* I'd say. It's a bit boring. 

**Mario Kart 7**: *Rosalina's Ice Worl*d. I just don't like it. Maybe I'm just bad at this track. 

**Mario Kart 8: Deluxe**: I don't own this game, but played it on my brother's Switch a few times, and I can't say I liked *Sweet Sweet Canyon* much. Just not a fan of the theme and the aesthetic, I guess. And as an F-Zero fan I also found *Big Blue* a bit disappointing. Not a bad track by any means, but not really what I was expecting out of it. 

Haven't played Mario Kart Wii, so can't say.

I can't get over how good the music is in Mario Kart 8 [MK8],"Every time I play Mario Kart 8, I'm just blown away by how good the music is. I *love* the fact that they used a live band (!) and not only re-recorded the music for the retro courses, but actually wrote new arrangements that are better suited to the new instrumentation.

The best example of this has to be the music to [GBA Mario Circuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQRhcDOLhTc&amp;t=143s). The new version stays true to the original in that you can still immediately recognize it, but the arrangement has a completely different feel and really ""fills out"" the sound. There's even a little guitar solo thrown in at the end. It's just killer!

The thing is, on paper, it makes absolutely no financial sense for Nintendo to do this. They could have  just reused existing music from the retro courses as is. Instead, they said no – let's hire a bunch of session musicians, have them write all-new arrangements for all of these songs, and then record them live and use that as the soundtrack!

I'm so glad there are people high enough up at Nintendo that are willing to give the green light to things like this, because *this* is the reason why I will instantly buy any new Mario or Mario Kart game without even looking at it first. They simply knock it out of the park with details like this and never disappoint.",mariokart

Why Mario Kart Tour Looked Disappointing,"I was really excited for Mario Kart Tour and i still am, however I have a few problems with the concepts they're using (keep in mind , I haven't played this gane but I do have information from it).

1. I dont mind the gacha system, it'll give it a fire emblem heroes like sense of wonder, anxiously waiting to see what awesome Mario (or crossover) character you'll get, but I have a hige problem with the common, rare etc part.  Common characters are easier to get but higher ups have more items and better stats.  This creates a huge rift in unbalance because theres no point in using common characters since they have one item and weaker stats.  Not only that but since theres only three ultra rare characters: Metal Mario, King Boo and Dry Bowser, meaning that the races will be littered with these characters.  Ultimately, common characters are useless.

2. The star boosts when you chooe your karts.  Instead of choosing a kart you like or because its stats might br useful, youre using top exclusive karts which again kills the fun out of seeing other players use different combinations

3. Microtransactions: Need I say more, it'll be Super Mario Run all over again!!",mariokart

[MK] (3rd of 4 surveys) How disreputable behavior can affect esports sponsors (Only for people who watch/participate in esports) [Ends on 24 August 2019],"Hello everyone, I’m doing my PhD in marketing and I’m focusing on esports sponsorships. Until the end of 2019, I will be doing 4 different surveys on this topic. Each survey will be launched only once and on different months to avoid fatiguing the community. The only exception is the 2nd survey which will be launched a second time, one month after all 4 surveys have been launched, because I need a larger sample for the 2nd survey.

&amp;#x200B;

All surveys are anonymous and done on Google Forms. The data from the surveys will only be used for my PhD thesis and to develop 6 articles that will be published in scientific journals. **The participation of all esports fans is extremely important and greatly appreciated (surveys are only for people who watch/participate in esports).**

&amp;#x200B;

**This is the 3rd survey. It takes about 8 minutes to complete and is related to how disreputable behavior can affect esports sponsors.** Here is the survey: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYVb78dHoj4KHRJ4dYsLEEN48jIfzcymjVCE0ukLq\_QwTlCQ/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYVb78dHoj4KHRJ4dYsLEEN48jIfzcymjVCE0ukLq_QwTlCQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)

**Items that should return** 

\*indicates that the item needs to be reworked (See my improvement section below)

\-Single mushroom

\-Tripple mushrooms

\-Banana 

\-Green Shell

\-Red shell

\-Blue/spiny shell

\-Blooper\*

\-Bullet Bill\*

\- Tripple bananas\*

\-Boo

\-Horn

Item improvements

Blooper: The blooper is one of the worst items to get in mario kart, but I have an idea to make it better. The first thing I would improve about the blooper is the ink to cover more of the screen. The next thing that I would add is to make everyone spin out when they get hit by the blooper like the pow from mario kart wii. Finally, in addition to spinning out like they would with the pow, the people getting hit by the blooper should also lose 3 coins.

Bullet Bill: The bullet bills were pretty bad in mario kart 8/deluxe so nintendo should return bullets to how they were like in mario kart wii

Tripple bananas: The tripple bananas should no longer rotate around you, and instead act like they did in previous games where they all are put behind your kart",mariokart

"To those that prefer [MK8] for Wii U over [MK8D] for the Switch, why is that?","The general consensus is that MK8D is an upgrade from the original Wii U game in every regard. There are plenty of points to be made justifying what an upgrade MK8D is. However, I know quite a few people that think otherwise.

Is it because that it is little more than a port? (Even so, if you had a Wii U and Switch and had to choose between either game, MK8D was the cheaper game in the end for all its content apparently.) Is it because you want to be savvy in thrashing the Switch and praising the Wii U? Is it just more comfortable to play the Wii U version instead? Curious to hear the response for this one.",mariokart

[MK8DX] Smartbouncing exists,"I've read a lot about a mechanic called ""smartbouncing"" that supposedly is in MK8DX and makes green shells bounce in such a way that they hit karts when they would've missed otherwise.

I was very skeptical about that and thought it was just a hoax and that green shell hits were more common only due to the increased size of shells in MK8DX and their faster speed. But what happened today on rYV can only be explained with smart bouncing:

https://media.giphy.com/media/SSbkQKfZKlBNyrws0i/giphy.gif

Unfortunately the camera angles are dumb in MKTV and I forgot to clip it, but what happened was that I threw the green shell forwards to have it bounce off the second small, red ""wall"" on the left side of the track, right after the goal line and hit the opponent in 1nst place - and the green shell bounced from the wall in an almost 180 degree angle right into me. There's no way a green shell would bounce in such an angle if there was no smartbouncing.",mariokart
How to Use the Jetsetter in [MKWii],"Many people will spit on the Jetsetter because of its high speed and weight but abysmal everything else.  However, as a person who played a lot of Mario Kart Wii, I can say that the Jetsetter is better when its drift is set to AUTO instead of MANUAL.

This is because its Mini Turbo can be seen as a dump stat and since when you use MANUAL, you will lose speed when you turn but when you use AUTO, you won't lose speed and the handling will have more use since you're directly transitioning handling to drift, giving the stat more use.

I'm not saying you'll be winning against Flame Runners but the Jetsetter requires much more skill than the Flame Runner (because the Flame Runner is OP).  If you use the Jetsetter on AUTO, it will run much more smoothly.",mariokart

My Thoughts on the Flame Runner in [MKWii],"Its a fun killing OP bike that lacks skill to use.  People will rag on Jetsetter and say dont use it because theyre lazy but I think you should stay away from Flame Runner.

Why? Because unlike Jetsetter or Spear, Flame Runner doesnt require skill to use.  Yeah it wins races but again its a crutch.  Its like a lot of top tier Smash characters, a crutch.  With the Jetsetter, its low stats puts you at a disadvantage but its a test for you to upgrade your skills and push past them.  The Spear complety kills any skill gain due to its OP combo of high Speed and Drift.

All I'm saying is explore, use karts and bikes that actually require skill to use, it makes victory more satisfying.

Why do I call it a fun killer? Well, online is loaded with Funky Kongs and Daisys so if you went into Mario Kart Wii online expecting unique combinations? Do me a favor, go to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, way better combo opportunities

If you want an inner drift bike with high speed, use Spear because unlike Flame Runner, it actually requires skill to use",mariokart

[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe] Coin Collecting question,"Hey guys, so I work at a gaming venue where we do MK8D Tournaments every week. We got a bunch of new Switches in that need to have Mr Scooty and Biddybuggy unlocked by Saturday (I've got to do this for 10 switches, yay). 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that I'm getting conflicting information. All of the major farming guides online from Polygon and the sort say to do the Luigi AFK method on Moo Moo Meadows, but then other comments say that only first player benefits from the coins. I don't have a lot of time and don't want to run a 48 race set up to find out that only first player got the coins anyway. 

I just need to know if it's worth putting more than 2 players in for these AFK races, because Polygon and Gamexplain both seem to say that you want more people because BOTH players average about 4-6 coins a race. 

I appreciate the help!",mariokart

Basically a list of every character I could possibly want from Mario Kart in one roster - My 73-character roster for Mario Kart 9 [MK],"Mario Kart 9 has been awaiting the community for years now, and with a very likely 2020 release date, I thought I'd post about my complete list of every character I could possibly want. I've also included a Special Power mechanic, just like in Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, to every character. There are 75 SPs, so some will probably be similar (e.g. Cranky Kong and Shiverian, just note that these characters are in the roster. It'll give you an idea as to how many characters I've decided to put into the game.)

First, I'll be covering characters that I'm not including in my roster that have been in previous games. First, basically all clones. (Side note: I have Metal Cap and Sandstorm both as items, with Metal Cap making you invincible but slightly slower, and Sandstorm basically doing the same thing as Blooper. Hence, Metal Mario, Pink Gold Peach, Gold Mario, etc. are not playable, but just forms of existing characters, and Blooper might be playable.)

CHARACTERS THAT ARE NOT RETURNING (AND WHY):

**Paratroopa:** Is included as part of Koopa Troopa's SP, so I didn't really see the need of bringing him back as playable.

**Baby Daisy:** Yeah. I'll explain this a little more later, but basically, Baby Daisy just sucks.

**Metal Mario:** Metal Cap is a powerup, Metal Mario does exist sometimes.

**Honey Queen:** Spoilers: I really hate MK7's roster. It has so many unnecessary and ridiculous characters. Like this!

**Wiggler:** Another one that doesn't make sense. They had to give him gloves so he could drive the car...that says it all.

**Lakitu:** This might be controversial, I know that people like Lakitu, but I personally don't. He serves his purpose anyways.

**Tanooki Mario:** No surprise here.

**Cat Peach:** No surprise here either.

**Baby Rosalina:** Technically destroys canon, also just isn't innovative at all. Yet again, there is an alternative I'll explain later.

**Gold Mario**: Nope, again.

**Pink Gold Peach:** What else is there to say?

**Non-Nintendo Characters:** Love 'em. Haven't got around to putting them in. I want them in eventually, though.

Alright, with that out of the way, let's take a look at my full roster (and the SP for each character)!

*Note: I wasn't really planning on uploading this while writing it, so some things might be slightly stupid. Take these as you will.*

**Mario: Ferocious Fireballs**

*Mario launches three massive fireballs, which race down the track and scorch anyone in the way. They cover most of the raceway, and they bounce off walls, so pay close attention to them!*

**Luigi: Poltergust 6000**

*Instead of launching foes away immediately, Luigi sucks them up with his vacuum, the Poltergust 6000, before shooting them into the distance. Make sure to go nowhere near Luigi as he uses the Poltergust 6000, because you’ll end up flying off into the background!*

**Wario: Wario-Man Transformation**

*Wario turns into Wario-Man, his superhero alter-ego, turning him invincible and giving anyone who goes near him a slap in the face. He also swaps his kart for the Wario Bike and zooms past the competition! It’s a three-in-one combo, so watch out for all three!*

**Waluigi: Rapid-Fire Racket**

*Waluigi gains a tennis racket and a practically unlimited supply of tennis balls, homing onto all nearby opponents and slamming them with a powerful serve to the face, much like his appearances in tennis games! Stay out of the way of Waluigi in his rapid-fire mode!*

**Peach: Love Shield**

*It may not seem like a great powerup at first, but Love Shield gives Peach full immunity to all projectiles coming her way, and also gives her a speed boost. Peach can’t damage you in any way, but nothing can damage her, either! Consider it a peaceful robbery of your victory.*

**Daisy: Love Boost**

*Much like Peach’s Love Shield, but with more of a boost and less immunity. Certain items like Lightning or another character’s SP can hurt Daisy during her SP, she also gets an insane speed boost. Careful; she’s what other racers like to call a ‘glass cannon’. Use her wisely!*

**Rosalina: Launch Star Liftoff**

*Unlike most SPs, Rosalina’s Launch Star Liftoff can do one of two things. If you throw the Launch Star, it sends any opponent who drives into it backwards in the course. If you just drop it where you are, it will launch you forwards in the course! This is one of the most strategic SPs in the game!*

**Bowser: Fierce Fire Breath**

*Bowser unleashes a powerful attack that he can use: Fire Breath. If you’re in front of Bowser while he’s using his SP, be prepared to be burnt to a crisp! However, if you’re behind Bowser, you need to watch out for the spikes on the back of his kart!*

**Toad: Turnip Toss**

*Toad takes a special ability from Captain Toad and throws turnips at his rivals. Even though they usually don’t do much in their games, the turnips Toad throws are Stitch-face Turnips, meaning that they’re much more devastating than your normal vegetable!*

**Toadette: Expert Navigator**

*Toadette takes her headlight from the Captain Toad series and uses it to find secret passages that other characters can’t race on. Don’t worry about falling off of them, either; they have guard rails, protecting you from the danger of a very narrow invisible passageway!*

**Boom Boom: Incredible Invisibility**

*Boom Boom turns himself and his kart invisible and flails his arms around, causing anyone he crashes into to spin out. You can still hear Boom Boom if you have your volume loud enough, but there’s no visual indication if he’s right behind you!*

**Pom Pom: Shuriken Shot**

*In her SP, Pom Pom uses her signature shurikens and throws them at foes! She gets five shots, which all home on a racer near her, and the last is pink instead of blue, acting like a Bob-omb and causing much more devastating than the blue shurikens!*

**Bowser Jr., Larry, Morton, Wendy, Iggy, Roy, Lemmy, Ludwig: Boxing Clown Car**

*Bowser Jr., Larry, Morton, Wendy, Iggy, Roy, Lemmy, and Ludwig all swap into Koopa Clown Cars and use giant extendable (and rotatable) boxing gloves to punch all nearby racers. Watch out for the red fists coming your way!*

**Yoshi: Good Egg Giant**

*Yoshi’s SP lets him throw a giant egg that demolishes any character that it drives over. On stages like Bowser’s Castle, beware; Yoshi’s SP can also set racers on fire if it happens to come in contact with some boiling lava! Watch out for the Fire Egg Threat!*

**Poochy: Poochy Pup Parade**

*Poochy gathers a bunch of Poochy Pups that protect him from any enemies or projectiles, while also being willing to leave the pack to cling onto another racer’s kart. If they cling onto a kart, that kart will be slowed down, and the racer must hop to shake the pup off!*

**Koopa Troopa: Paratroopa Pass**

*For Koopa Troopa’s SP, he turns into a Paratroopa and flies into the air! You can use this ability to make insane short-cuts or simply avoid most items for a little. Beware, though; Lightning strikes will send you right back down to the ground! Keep an eye out!*

**Chargin' Chuck: Diggin' Chuck's Demand**

*Chargin’ Chuck turns into Diggin’ Chuck and throws rocks around like Green Shells, but faster. You’re going to need some agility to dodge these speedy boulders, but if playing on a Mario Circuit, they’ll be even faster, since it’ll be a Confused Chuck throwing baseballs instead! Watch out for those!*

**Shy Guy: Fly Guy to the Rescue**

*Like Rosalina’s, Shy Guy’s SP does two different actions. When thrown, a Fly Guy will take another random character up and away into the air, and they have to fall back down to keep racing. If held until the racer falls off the course, Fly Guy will save them instead of Lakitu and let them go further ahead.*

**Hammer Bro: Hammer Hurl**

*Much like Hammer Bros in Mario games, Hammer Bro’s SP will randomly throw a barrage of hammers at any nearby opponents. Stay away from this powerful attack, or else you might just be stuck in the range of a Hammer Bro and be constantly stopping and starting from the hammers!*

**Sumo Bro: Shock Wave Stun**

*Sumo Bro stomps his foot, causing a shock wave all around him. If a character is stuck in the shock wave, they will have an effect similar to the effects of being hit by a Thundercloud from Mario Kart Wii. The electricity, however, will make Sumo Bro go faster!*

**Birdo: Extreme Egg Extravaganza**

*Unlike Yoshi’s SP, which is just one massive egg, Birdo shoots multiple eggs in all directions, which break (and explode) if they hit a wall with no direct encounters. Being around Birdo while this attack is occurring is extremely dangerous, so keep your distance!*

**Pianta: Driver Delivery**

*Pianta gets a major speed boost, and any racer it runs into, it picks up and throws off the stage. If Pianta is going faster than you think Pianta should be going, then you’d better get away from them as soon as possible, or you’ll be tossed away!*

**Donkey Kong: One-Two Tremble**

*Donkey Kong slams his hands against the ground, essentially replicating an earthquake for anyone who is in close range. You can short-hop over the dust waves, but you’ll need to leave the vicinity before the final blow shows up and makes all racers nearby spin out!*

**DK Junior.: Ivy Vine Venture**

*D.K. Junior creates two ivy vines from the ground, and climbs them up to the top of the stage. From here, he is taken to a random spot far ahead of him, which is usually substantially far ahead, since D.K. Junior must climb the vines first to get there. This one is very chance-based, but can certainly pay off!*

**Diddy Kong: Rocket Racing**

*Diddy Kong puts on his barrel jetpack and zooms forward in the course. He also has a stream of smoke behind him because of how fast he’s going, and that can make it hard to see, and you might spin out if he hits you while going fast enough. Stay away from the little DK!*

**Dixie Kong: Bruised Banana Bunch**

*Dixie Kong’s SP is a bunch of five bananas, but these aren’t just regular bananas; they’re Bruised Bananas, meaning that if a racer runs into one, they’ll be stuck in the ground for a while. Make sure you throw these in the right spots, because even if they aren’t easy to avoid, they can still definitely be avoided!*

**Cranky Kong: Cane Bounce**

*Cranky Kong uses his canes from Donkey Kong Country Returns: Tropical Freeze to bounce all over the stage. Not only does this give Cranky a significant boost, but it also means he can take some risky shortcuts over endless pits, but depending on your skill level, you might want to avoid doing it.*

**Funky Kong: Surf 'n' Slide**

*Funky Kong ditches his vehicle and rides his surfboard instead, racing much faster, but making turning much more loose and slippery. Anyone who is caught in the surf will skid out, so be careful of where Funky Kong last was, and don’t be there!*

**Kritter: Rocks and Bombs Away**

*Kritter has two uses for his SP; he can either throw rocks, which are very fast projectiles that break on impact, and the debris from a shattered rock can be used as obstacles, or use bombs, which are slower and smaller, but are much more devastating!*

**King K. Rool: Cannonball Crash**

*King K. Rool takes on his pirate outfit and blasts heavy cannonballs around his vehicle. Since they are very heavy, they don’t go very far, but they can be devastating. It’s not too hard to avoid, but you’ll need to be 100% sure that you do, or else you’ll get demolished!*

**Pauline: Mayor's Guard**

*Pauline, being the mayor of New Donk City, has an authoritative SP. She gains many boosts during her SP, one of which causing any character nearby to be stunned from her singing, and a remarkable speed boost akin to her appearance in Mario Tennis Aces. Careful; her voice isn’t harmless in this game!*

**Spike: Spiked Ball Striker**

*Spike throws spiked balls in all directions, but has to slow down to throw them behind him, because he needs to turn around. They are very powerful, but be warned, because if you aim them incorrectly, they can bounce back to you, and you’re not immune to them!*

**Whomp: Boulder Barricade**

*Whomp, being a slab of rock with arms and legs, isn’t very agile, but with his SP, he can cause others to come to a complete stop. Whomp turns into a Big Whomp and turns his kart into complete stone, causing anyone who touches it (or gets run over by it) gets completely flattened. Watch out!*

**King Boo: Boo's Boost**

*King Boo calls on its minion Boos, which give it incredible boosts and also turn King Boo invisible. His speed is drastically increased, and his Boos can also steal items from other players if you so please. However, the less Boos that are around you, the slower you go, so think carefully!*

**Broozer: Bash 'n' Smash**

*Broozer slams his fists repeatedly while going in a straight line, demolishing anyone or anything that is in the way. The broken rocks in stages on the walls mean that Broozer can punch his way through them to find secret shortcuts! Watch out for these shortcuts!*

**Peepa: Floating Feint**

*Peepa turns invisible, just like Boom Boom, but instead of damaging foes, it can pass through certain walls! These walls are the same walls that Broozer can punch through, but this time, it doesn’t open up the way for any other character to use the shortcut!*

**Luma: Star Bit Sprinkle**

*Luma gathers up a group of other Lumas to cover it in Star Bits, giving it full invulnerability and invincibility to everything, and also a much faster recovery from falling off stages. Basically, nothing can stop you while you’re using Luma’s SP!*

**Sprixie Princess: Fairy Dust Flutter**

*Sprixie Princess is a unique SP, because instead of just one character, or characters near Sprixie Princess, Fairy Dust Flutter hits every single racer moderately. A coating of fairy dust is sprinkled all over the stage, and those who are hit become noticeably slower and drowsier, rendering them vulnerable.*

**Greenie: Dastardly Disguise**

*Greenie disguises itself as another racer, and gains that character’s SP. Although some similar SPs exist, Greenie’s SP is based on the character who is in first place, and if used while in first place, whoever is in last. Use this to your advantage, and if you see a racer you want to mimic in 2nd place, just wait!*

**R.O.B.: Laser Launcher**

*R.O.B. has a unique projectile, because instead of launching from the side, it launches straight ahead, blasting any characters who happen to be in contact with it. Make sure you have your volume up so you can hear R.O.B. approaching, and avoid the laser!*

**Dry Bones: Bone-Crushing Bonemerang**

*Dry Bones’s SP lets him throw bones in all directions. The unique trait about this projectile is that they’ll go on until they hit someone, so even if you’re half a lap behind the competition, this powerful projectile will catch up to them eventually! Bananas, green shells and other items on the track stop it, however.*

**Kamek: Magic Mayhem**

*Kamek uses his magic sceptre, which is a powerful attack with a little bit of luck involved. Every time he uses it, he also teleports to a nearby spot, but it’s completely random. This can be good and bad, so take your pick as to how much you should use this SP!*

**Nabbit: Racing Robbery**

*Nabbit gets a speed boost until he runs into a racer, or for an extended period of time. He then takes that racer, and their special item, and throws the racer off the course. It might be a good idea not to hit a racer, because the speed boost might be better for your current situation!*

**Blooper: Inky Interference**

*Although the Blooper item is long gone, Blooper’s SP shares some resemblance to it. Not only does the ink cover most of the players’ screen, but it also adds ink splotches to the race course, making newcomers or simply unlucky racers spin out from the ink spill!*

**Penguin: Super Penguin Slide**

*Penguin doesn’t have as much as a name, but can still be a powerful racer! He’s also much better while sliding across the ground, and he turns into Super Penguin while doing it, so you might want to watch out! You’ll spin out if you’re hit by him!*

**E. Gadd: F.L.U.D.D. Pack Flight**

*E. Gadd gains full usage of the F.L.U.D.D. pack, choosing between the Squirt, Hover, Rocket or Turbo nozzle at will, since he created the robot. Squirt works as a basic projectile; Hover can be used to make small shortcuts and fly; Rocket will shoot you into the air for you to hover with Hover; Turbo gives you a major speed boost.*

**Toadsworth: Toad House Twister**

*Toadsworth is usually in charge of Toad Houses, but this time, he gets to use them for himself! He gets five random power-ups in Mystery Boxes, and gets to use all of them in the race! The odds are about three racers below your current standing, so they’ll all be better than normal!*

**Topper: Hat Hielaman**

*Topper, the first of the four Broodals, surrounds itself in hats for protection. If anything hits the shield of hats, the item will immediately home back in on the racer who sent it, but it removes one of the eight hats in the process, leaving a weak spot in the shield when it gets down to five. Use it wisely!*

**Hariet: Spiky Bomb Strike**

*Hariet throws explosive bombs at other racers, which are devastating, but can also be hit back by a shield of any kind (except Daisy’s Love Boost). If you use these menacing projectiles, either you need to know when to use them or you need to know that the racer doesn’t know you will!*

**Rango: Catapult Cap**

*Rango doesn’t use his hat as a projectile, but instead uses it to launch his own vehicle. This lets him glide back down to the ground, giving him a slight speed boost, but also letting him take unique shortcuts that you cannot access on the ground.*

**Spewart: Poison Protection**

*There are two ways to use Spewart’s SP. You can use it to protect yourself by making a circle of poison around you that stays for the longest of any shields, or you can use it as a projectile to prevent other racers from going in certain places on the raceway.*

**Dry Bowser: Blue Burning Blast**

*This is a type of fire, but different from Mario’s and Bowser’s, since it is one massive shot that goes in a straight line until it is out of the racetrack. This burning ball is not something you want to be hit by in any circumstance; the blue in the fire represents the blue shell, but much worse. Avoid at all costs.*

**Petey Piranha: Cage Capture**

*Petey Piranha throws cages at the other racers. If one hits a racer, they need to mash the buttons on their controller, because if they stay in long enough, Petey Piranha will steal their item (and they’ll lose a lot of time from being stuck in the cage).*

**Geno: Geno Whirl**

*Much like Geno Whirl in Super Mario RPG, Geno’s SP can be insanely devastating if timed right. Geno sends a magic blade forward, which is rather slow-moving, but does slow down the opponents. However, if you use the move at just the right time, indicated by a circle around the item, it immediately destroys racers!*

**Tostarenan: Dawn of the Dead**

*For Tostarenan’s SP, it transforms into Chincho, the undead version of itself. Chincho can go much faster and pass through certain walls, also not being able to be hit by any items. Make sure to look for the blue force-field on walls that Chincho can go through!*

**Lochlady: Sea Shield**

*Lochlady creates a veil of water around her, protecting her from racers and most items, although Lightning is much more impactful due to Lochlady being underwater. When in the water, she can move much more swiftly and take shortcuts in underwater levels.*

**New Donker; Treacherous Taxi Trip**

*New Donker ditches the kart and hops into a taxi, which takes them far ahead in the course without them having to do anything. The transportation takes much less than a Bullet Bill, but also goes less in terms of distance, so depending on what you personally are going for, this is usually much better.*

**Steam Gardener: Rocket Flower Racer**

*Steam Gardeners live in the Wooded Kingdom, which is home to the world’s largest supply of Rocket Flowers. This flower is what they use for their SP, making them go incredibly fast, but without any other good or bad side effects. It’s a very basic SP that doesn’t require too much strategy.*

**Shiverian: Bouncing Boost**

*For his SP, Shiverian decides to ditch the kart and bounce along the racetrack instead. While doing this, you can get major boosts by hopping immediately while touching the ground, but if you miss the timing, you’ll still make great strides and possibly make shortcuts!*

**King Bob-omb: Extreme Explosion**

*King Bob-omb’s SP is, in typical Bob-omb fashion, the most destructive of all of them. King Bob-omb explodes most of the entire stage in one big boom, but it ends in his own destruction, forcing him to explode and reappear thanks to Lakitu. This is the most impactful of all of the SPs!*

**Glydon: Stop, Drop and Drive**

*Glydon takes flight, launching himself far into the air, and from there, you can do one of two things; glide all the way down, since it’s faster than racing, or dive-bomb a racer and continue racing. Glydon will act as a blue shell and the racer will completely spin out.*

**Monty Mole: Undercover Digger**

*Monty Mole burrows underground, where he goes much faster than in a cart, and pops up further in the course. If he is below someone when he pops out of the ground, they’ll spin out. Watch out for the dirt clumps on the raceway, because you might be attacked by a Monty Mole!*

**Fawful: Mechawful Maraud**

*Fawful summons an army of Mechawfuls that search for nearby racers, and will punch any that they find. Although the punches don’t make the racer spin out, they do cause a complete loss of momentum, so using Fawful’s SP while near a big jump could cause racers to miss the ground at the end of it!*

**Baby Mario: Baby Power**

*Baby Mario unlocks all of the special abilities from Yoshi's Island DS; Baby Mario can dash much faster, and M Blocks will appear throughout the raceway. You can drive on these M Blocks, which allows major shortcuts depending on which stage you're playing on.*

**Baby Luigi: Strategic Crybaby Chaos**

*Baby Luigi doesn't do much, so he capitalizes on his vulnerability for his SP. Even though just crying may seem like a terrible strategy, it causes all other players to be confused, slowing them down and making their own items hit themselves instead of other opponents.*

**Baby Peach: Rage Vibe Ruckus**

*Baby Peach will activate her Rage Vibe,  This means that she will be surrounded by flames, making her very dangerous to go near, and go much faster. This will also light up dark areas, but  most importantly, she can destroy the weak brick blocks in the walls, allowing for secret shortcuts!*

**Baby Wario: Magnetic Mayhem**

*With his sizable magnet, Baby Wario draws all items and racers near him. If a racer comes too near to Baby Wario, he can steal their powerup before it's on the field, but once you feel like you have enough people brought in, you can slam the magnet against the ground to stun them!*

**Baby Yoshi (Balloon): Inflation Elimination**

*Baby Yoshi (Balloon) puffs up like a balloon, causing them to fly far into the sky.  You can start descending at any time that you'd like, but remember not to stay in the sky for too long, since if you go above the clouds, you'll be going slower than you'd be going on the ground!*

**Baby Yoshi (Bubble): Bubble Trouble**

*Baby Yoshi (Bubble) uses their bubbles as a basic projectile, but once they come into contact with another racer, that racer gets stuck in the bubble. They have to jump repeatedly for a chance to pop the bubble and keep racing, and if they don't, they'll lose seven seconds!*

**Baby Yoshi (Glowing):  Glow and Know**

*Baby Yoshi (Glowing) lights up the way around them, but lights up a little bit more from your own perspective. In fact, he lights up the hidden secret shortcuts from Toadette's SP, but the difference is that Baby Yoshi (Glowing) reveals the section of the shortcut that he's on. If  somebody is right next to him, they can also take the shortcut, but otherwise, they'll fall off!*

**Cappy: Possession Power** 

*Cappy targets a nearby character and possesses them, but since he can’t shift the other racer’s body into any other character, he simply takes their Special Power-up instead of fully capturing them. If you can see Cappy flashing bright colours, keep your distance!*

**Tiara: Anti-Assisted Amplification** 

*Tiara doesn’t possess racers like Cappy, but instead uses an Assist-Mode-esque strategy: ditching the kart and flying through the course. Tiara will always be just slightly above ground level, but she can also spin out other racers that she bounces into. However, this slows Tiara down slightly, so choose your style!*

***The last traditional racer in my roster is...***

**Soundfrog: A Groove So Funky**

Hear me out on this one.

I'm going to make this quick, since my Internet is sputtering on and off, and I don't know how much of this will be saved, but basically, Super Mario Maker 2 shows that Soundfrog isn't really a frog, but rather, just pretending to be a frog. He's actually built like a full-grown man (of course, with the personality of anything but), so he could drive a car, and I just really love the characters that nobody was expecting. They almost always become a fan favorite; who expected Funky Kong in MKWii? That's why I added Soundfrog; he works as a character, technically, but is just hilarious.

Here's his SP: 

*The strangest character in Super Kart Bros, Soundfrog, does a powerful dance that, as it does in Super Mario Maker 2, makes “mountains move”, or in this case, the track move, with several pieces of each track being separated by earthquakes, or walls will move closer to the racetrack.*

Next are the two non-traditional characters. First, **Miis.** Of course, these need to be in the game. I'm hoping that the costumes from MK8 return, but maybe with some more costumes replacing some characters that didn't quite make it in.

The other character is something relatively completely new; **Miniis.** They're basically baby variants of Miis. This is my alternative to Baby Daisy and Baby Rosalina, because just imagine that they have the costumes available. I'm not going to list the costumes, because really, it could be anything. The SPs for the Miis will also be completely unique, and it could really be anything, but I've decided that if you're wearing the costume of a character that is playable, you'll have that SP. Amiibo functionality could also be worked in, but I don't really want to deal with that kind of thing.

And there you have it! That's all of the characters I'd probably play as in Mario Kart 9!  Of course, there are other characters I'd be fine with (Wart would be cool, Flutter at least has hands, and I'm all for another WTF character like DJ Ballyhoo), but this is my main list. Thanks for reading! I'm open to constructive criticism; nothing here is truly set in stone or anything. But man, this was really fun! I'd do more, but I'm worried that I won't be able to come up with a 76th unique SP...",mariokart
Unpopular Opinion: Nintendo Kart is a bad idea.,[removed],mariokart
[MK] Unpopular Opinion: Nintendo Kart is a bad idea.,"Recently, I've been seeing a lot of people saying that ""Instead of Mario Kart, they should change it to Nintendo Kart, where it has characters from all Nintendo franchises."" In my opinion, I just don't like that. You can't just take the formula from one of the best-selling racing franchises, and make it into a whole different game.

Super Smash Bros already is the grand Nintendo game, having all franchises, so why make another one with racing instead of fighting?  But, lets say they did change Mario Kart to Nintendo Kart. They would have to DRASTICALLY reduce the amount of Mario characters and Mario tracks to compensate for those in other series. So, if you mained someone like King Boo, Metal Mario, or Dry Bones, they are at VERY high risk for being removed from the game. Obviously, characters like Mario, Bowser, Peach and Toad aren't going to be removed, but a lot of others are.

On the other hand, people are suggesting to make Nintendo Kart a separate thing from Mario Kart, therefore keeping both. This could be a cool idea, but why have two AAA racing games out, that are essentially similar? People who have Nintendo Kart won't want to get Mario Kart (Which will hurt the sales badly) and people with Mario Kart just might not have the time to buy the same racing game with different characters and different tracks on the SAME console.

But, lets say making Mario Kart separate from Nintendo Kart does work (Which it probably won't). Then Nintendo would know that mixing franchises works and we will be seeing a lot more of that. Mario Party would become Nintendo Party. Mario Tennis would become Nintendo Tennis. Dr. Mario would become Dr. Nintendo (wait, wut). You can probably see what I'm saying here. Mario would be no longer separate from Link. Link would be no longer separate from Kirby. Kirby would be no longer separate from Animal Crossing. There would be no more true franchises, everything then would just be NINTENDO.  (This is very hypothetical but still)

Keeping characters in Mario Kart such as Link, Villager, Isabelle, and the Inklings are fine. Heck, adding in Kirby or Captain Falcon would be cool. Just please Nintendo, DONT MAKE NINTENDO KART.

PS- I don't like that name, Nintendo Kart.",mariokart

What I'm Trying to Say About the Jetsetter,"I clearly got somewhat of a bad reception with my last posts so this post is talking about what I'm trying to say about the Jetsetter.

What I'm trying to say about the Jetsetter is not about win or lose, but about skill and dedication.  True, it takes skill and dedication to use the Flame Runner, but it takes a lot more skill and dedication to use the Jetsetter.  Think of it, the Flame Runner can score wins like crazy while you need to put in more effort to use the Jetsetter, this shows that you need more dedication to do well with the Jetsetter than you do with something that scores wins without much try.

I admit that if the Jetsetter didn't have the options of AUTO or MANUAL, it would be screwed due to how it has 2 out of 7 good stats (Speed and Weight), meaning from a stats stand point, the Jetsetter is at a 71% disadvantage, but since it has AUTO, youre getting rid of one dump stat of the Jetsetter (Mini-Turbo) in exchange for giving more use to the other two stats (Handling and Drift) as well as taking advantage of its high Speed, giving it around a 4 out of 7 advantage or around 43% disadvantage, allowing it to do somewhat better.

My point is is thst I feel the Jetsetter was put in as a ""challenge kart"" where it has statistical disadvantages but it takes skilled players to do well with it.  Just like how the Flame Runner is a crutch bike where it doesnt require huge skill and dedication to win with but you can win easier, the Jetsetter is a challenge kart where it has poor stats, but requires the player to be good to do well with it.

Besides, with the Jetsetter, just getting top 4 in a competitive can be seen as a victory",mariokart

[MKDS] The story of MKDS's greatest player - TB1,"I want to share to this sub a story of arguably one of the greatest Mario Kart DS players of all time, TB1 aka たべい・１ aka Thomas Bolton. 

In the ""golden age"" of MKDS, 2005-2008, TB1 dominated every scene - wifi AND time trials. This was exceptionally impressive back then as time trials and wifi had different speeds - wifi using 100cc and time trials using 150cc. I will talk about his Time Trials dominance, and then his legendary wifi legacy that he left behind.

He had started to play the game when it first came out and was an avid time trialer on a French site for competitive MKDS times. Since there were no online leaderboards like we have today, back then we had to send in times online to sites. In 2006, Thomas joined the biggest time trialing website at the time, the Players' Page. His times from the French site already ranked him at #5 overall. 

TB1 mostly stood out in the Non-PRB category of the MKDS time trial scene. If you don't know, PRB is a glitch used in MKDS, with a perfect startboost, you can keep chaining mini turbos and your start boost will last infinitely as long as you mini turbo fast enough over and over, which means you can go through grass and other off road terrain that would slow you down at max speed. 

There are ""standards"" used on the Players Page, with the highest standard being ""God"". For each track's 3 lap and fast lap time, there are specific ranges of times that are placed in these different tiers. For example, if you want to get a God 3lap time on Figure Eight Circuit in the PRB category, you would have to get a time between 1""12""000 and 1""12""200. Although TB1's last time was in 2014, he currently holds almost half of PRB God times, and holds 64/64 God times for Non-PRB. 

Over the years, he had also gotten 357 different World Records, although only one holds up today. TB1 also has the claim to fame for having the 2nd longest lasting World Record - a fast lap time on Choco Island 2 set in 2009 lasted 3032 days: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myBL8xAig5c

While achieving this world records in Time Trials, TB1 also set out to be the best Wi-Fi player of all time. And without a doubt, he was. The only players who ever came close to matching him in his prime were the Japanese players MiTi, NTTWestJPN, and Icarus. It's not known how much wins he actually accumulated over the years as his game cartridge was erased frequently, but there are multiple images of TB1 with insane Win/Loss records such as this: https://i.imgur.com/OTyoV6W.png 

TB1 proved his worthyness of the greatest Wi-Fi player of all time when he faced two opponents in a few recorded Wi-Fi races: vs NTTWestJPN, and vs Icarus, both unknown, Japanese players. NTT had appeared in 2007 as a mediocre player and was defeated by TB1 fairly easily. He reappeared in 2008 in a online Japanese chat room. TB1 was the only foreigner who knew about this Japanese chat, and NTT requested to race him. The result is the following videos: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcI8rkA4PkE

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsS3EShGI5I

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVAb2UsGss

The quality is obviously atrocious as it was 2008 and recording Wi-Fi games while playing your best was pretty hard. As you can (sort of) see in these videos, the skill displayed in the videos are extremely high by both players. TB1 and NTT were so good that they came close to breaking 100cc World Records in these races. They played 3 GPs and the matches ended, TB1 winning vs NTT with 90 points - 70 points. E

Quote from TB1 about NTT: 

&gt;There were and will always be doubts about whether he hacked or not, as he appeared for 2 days only, displayed a tremendous level (as fast if not faster than me, although I had been actively playing since the release) and didn't provide any video or other proof of his level. Furthermore, his strats were unconventional, and I cannot recall him missing a single mt (for instance, he 3lap PRBed Mario Circuit three times on three against me on wifi, which at the time could only be achieved extremely rarely by few top level racers).

Even though NTT was a very suspicious player and was thought to be maybe cheating, TB1 had still managed to beat him, while recording it. Now, as if this wasn't impressive enough, I present to you this videos:

These 3 videos are vs the, supposedly, Japanese player Icarus. Like NTT, Icarus appeared out of nowhere, with no previous background, and displayed an extremely high level of skill vs TB1. In these videos, TB1 responds to his challenge and it results with one of the greatest played wifi matches of all time, in terms of skill. I believe these set of videos vs Icarus prove that he is the greatest player of all time, and you will know why this is true when I tell you a secret about Icarus. 

Here are the times and results from these matches vs Icarus. Both TB1 and Icarus came within hundreths of a second to the 100cc WR's on their first try on Wi-Fi, all within one match. 

Figure8Circuit - 1'28'0xx - WR at the time was 1'27'2xx

The two had little to no mistakes, at all. 

Quote from TB1 about NTT:

&gt;There were and will always be doubts about whether he hacked or not, as he appeared for 2 days only, displayed a tremendous level (as fast if not faster than me, although I had been actively playing since the release) and didn't provide any video or other proof of his level.

These 3 videos are vs the, supposedly, Japanese player Icarus. Like NTT, Icarus appeared out of nowhere, with no previous background, and displayed an extremely high level of skill vs TB1. In these videos, TB1 responds to his challenge and it results with one of the greatest played wifi matches of all time, in terms of skill. Both TB1 and Icarus were just milliseconds between each other on every race. I believe these set of videos vs Icarus prove that he is the greatest player of all time, and you will know why this is true when I tell you a secret about Icarus.

Here are the times and results from these matches vs Icarus. Both TB1 and Icarus came within hundreths of a second to the 100cc WR's on their first try on Wi-Fi, all within one match. These are TB1's times that he got in the races vs Icarus: 

Figure8Circuit - 1'28'0xx - WR at the time was 1'27'2xx

Yoshi Falls - 55'9xx - WR at the time was 55'430

Cheep Cheep Beach - 1'38'2xx - WR at the time was 1'37'728

Luigi's Mansion - 1'49'6xx - WR at the time was 1'47'937

Delfino Square - 1'49'4xx - WR at the time was 1'49'318

Mario Circuit - 1'44'6xx (by NTT) - WR at the time is believed to be around 1'44'4xx. This one stands out especially because Icarus had held his PRB for all 3 laps, this course is without a doubt the hardest to hold PRB and could only be done by TB1 and maybe 1 or 2 other players, very rarely on Wi-Fi. 

Choco Mountain - 2'06'5xx - WR at the time was 2'05'464.

Yoshi Circuit - 1'40'3xx - WR at the time was 1'39'586.



Now, what I have waited to write here is that the player TB1 was facing in these videos was cheating. Icarus was a player from the United Kingdom named Casey-B. Casey had a history of pretending to be Japanese for some reason. In this videos, Casey B named himself Icarus, pretended to be Japanese, and used an Action Replay (cheating) code to give himself Infinite-Mini Turbos, which basically removed the need for skill from the game. This wasn't known until years later when Casey confessed. 

Yet, despite this, TB1 still managed to defeat him, 75-65.

How To Improve At The Game? [MK8DX],"I recently got MK8DX and have been having a ton of fun playing with friends and family. Recently, I’ve noticed that I’ve been beating them by huge margins (like 10-15 seconds), so I took the jump to Online. Turns out I’m not as good as I thought I was. 

I find myself placing from 7-10th most of the time. I tried switching my build to a more optimized one but it didn’t help that much (although I definitely noticed an impact). Against CPUs, 150 CC is a breeze for me, but I will struggle a lot on 200 CC, especially on courses with lots of turns (like Bone-Dry Dunes). 

What strategies can I practice and use to get to the level of a skilled player? I do a lot of drifting, I know how to hold items like Bananas and Shells to block Red Shells, and I can do a couple of shortcuts. Thanks in advance.",mariokart

[MK8D] Is it common to find hackers in online matches?,"If it is possible what are the hacks? I’m not intending to hack my game but I’m getting suspicious after playing a handful of matches against one player who happened to win over half of the games we played. 

If he’s trailing he would somehow get only red shells and if he gets in first, he’d sometimes get bombs but mostly green shells. When he’s in first, gap between himself and everyone else is wide which I think is pretty common when playing online. 

What made me suspicious was when he got 4 red shells in 2nd place and used them all on me before taking first. 

When you’re in first the most common items you get are Coins, Bananas and green shells. But for him, he only gets bombs and green shells.

[MKT] Reservations about Mariokart Tour,"With the recent trailer and release date announced for Mariokart Tour, a lot of hype has built up quite quickly, but I can’t help but reserve my hype until I know that a) Controls become more dynamic (i.e no auto steering) and b) Funky Kong is confirmed.

Most importantly, however, I hope more than anything that the game supports online multiplayer.

Back in May(?) when the beta released it was discovered that the race opponents, despite being named as other players, were totally controlled by bots, which angered me as Mariokart has always been and should always be a game with— in addition to awesome single player— a strong multiplayer focus, be that local or online multiplayer.

Since the trailers were dropped and the game announced I have seen no mention of real, live, online multiplayer, only ‘online leaderboards’ which I assume are ranked based on time in a time trial mode, or score in some kind of challenge.

This has me worried— especially since I have seen many excited about playing with their friends— that these very people will be let down by the game’s lack of multiplayer (if that is indeed how it turns out).

I really really hope Nintendo do a good job with this, as it has so much potential (and that they also remember that this does not take the place of the eventual MK9).

If anyone does know more than I do, please let me know xx",mariokart

[MK] Torn between playing MK8D and MK7,"After years of playing (and thoroughly enjoying) MK8 and MK8D at friends places I finally bought the game when it was on sale on the switch weeks back

but I even after all these years I seem to enjoy MK7 that much more. Its trueMK8 IS the better game on paper and I'm still choked there is no single player vs. MK7 when played deeply is a pretty an fun game, strangely the 3DSes best seller. CTGP 7 breathes new life into the game.

I think the mechanics, while not as refined make it a little more enjoyable. little things like properly hold items and get another, Blue Shell actually doing MORE damage in this game (I swear the Red Shell is much worse in MK8) no coin item, and a somewhat uniquely better track list especially the retro, Online allows you to pick what you want.

MK8 has better graphics (shiner, but MK7 is still pretty good) and your momentium carries more if you fall off the track, but something about playing MK7 after all these years... and FINALLY getting to own and play MK8 whenever I want... it feels like video game fatigue at this rate though MK8 is great but there's something about 7 that hooks me more AND still has active online

Tencent is releasing a Mario Kart clone this month on mobile,[removed],mariokart
Do you think versus-exclusive obstacles ought to return to [Mario Kart]?,"In looking at mechanics from previous games that I enjoyed and was interested in seeing again, one that came to mind was a set of enemies that would appear exclusively in multiplayer versus in Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 64. If you played with your friends and not AI (really, back then there was no way to mix them together), the courses decided to make up for the lack of other racers by including more obstacles on the tracks. In SMK, these were chain chomps. In MK64, these were bomb karts. They were preset in certain areas throughout each course, ready to mess with you.

Honestly, I find it interesting that this feature never returned. I presume it ate too much into the processing power of what courses could handle in multiplayer, causing more aspects of each course to be removed (if you played MK64 with others you know exactly what I mean), so they decided to focus more on keeping as many course parts intact as possible, which would require ditching the versus-exclusive obstacles. I know MKSC struggles to put its multiplayer together close to release and had to ditch some things as a result, and MKDD seemed to follow suit. By MKDS, which allowed multiple players and AI to mix, it seemed to just disappear altogether.

Regardless, I do think this should return for non-AI races or even battles with other players as compensation for the lack of other racers in a massive space. What do you think about this?",mariokart
[MK8DX] does kart choice *really* matter when playing against ai?,"I know that there is a meta for the game and there are combinations that are ""the best""  but imo, they're all fugly.

[MK8DX] Help needed!,"Tl;dr: friend has an unusual MK8DX problem, needs help

So, a friend of mine has a problem with MK8DX that kinda destroys his enjoyment. Too clear it up, he has autism and sometimes has problems with the ""weirdest"" things one normally probably wouldn't notice (I didn't before either). 

If you play with 2 or more players locally and one of them has Smart Steering turned on and presses L/ZL (item use button) while not having an item equipped, sometimes the other player's character jumps out of the kart. I never noticed this before, but it's definitely a thing, tried it in several copies of the game. Try it out yourself.

This is obviously a very specific problem, that probably doesn't annoy almost anyone but him, but it would be great if there was some way to solve this. He has already written to Nintendo with the help of his father, but they only said they  couldn't do anything about it, not sure if they even looked into it at all, although I couldn't blame them I guess, it's pretty minor (except for him).

MKWii Team Vs. Data and Spreadsheets,[removed],mariokart
[MKWii] Team Versus Data and Spreadsheets," 

So I'm new to reddit and still don't know how it really works. I didn't know if I should file this under r/ wii or r/ mariokart or r/ addiction so I hope I'm putting it in multiple places.

For the past 4 years or so I've been playing mario kart wii every night (or almost every night - thats sunday thru saturday. Sometimes twice on sundays if my football team sucks). So what, you play it every night who cares? I dont play just any Mario Kart game - I play by my own rules:

1. Always Teams on hardest computer difficulty
2. Birdo is ALWAYS on the opponent team, otherwise you have to choose a different character at the beginning (Birdo also serves as a constant (I'll explain later)
3. I play 8 races, typically ones that share a certain theme such as 'commercial' areas only (Toad's Factory, Delfino Square, Coconut Mall, Moonview Highway, Wario's Gold Mine, Peach Beach, DK Summit and Moo Moo Meadows)
4. I hit the weed pen before **every** race in the 8 game circuit. Sometimes I drink too if I feel like it
5. I record everything in a spreadsheet.

[mario kart wii player scores](https://i.redd.it/rapd628pkq931.jpg)

Every night.

[mkwii input](https://i.redd.it/qijhyk2qkq931.jpg)

I chart everything

[mk wii player scores chart](https://i.redd.it/zl6hxk6rkq931.jpg)

I guess it's my way of relaxing or something... getting ripped and playing mario kart wii. I HAVE to play it too. Even if I decide to go out to the bars after work or something, I'll come home at 3am piss drunk and play mario kart wii before going to sleep.

It's actually more challenging than you might think. With 8 courses in a circuit, you can only score 120 pts at the most (1st worth 15pts per course). I've only reached that score 2 times.

I'm also not getting fast starts because I'm drinking/smoking/both for about the first 10 seconds of the race.

[median, avg and inverted 1st place &amp;#37; for each course](https://i.redd.it/f7x7sweskq931.jpg)

Before you go report me to the nearest drug counselor, please note that i don't always smoke the devils lettuce while playing mario kart. Just **usually**. Like 3 to 5 times/week. Other nights I might just have diet coke (maybe with whiskey) instead

I've been keeping track of basically any statistic you could possibly want to know on mario kart wii. I mean, they're all based on my driving habits, but I can tell you the easiest team courses, the hardest, what computers stray to the more skilled side, and which ones don't.

I don't know why. Just shit I wanted to know when I'm stoned so I keep track of it all. Now it's habit.

I'll reply with answers if you have any questions.

Does anyone else do shit like this?",mariokart

[MKWii] I'd like to acknowledge that there have been 3 new Ultra shortcuts found in Mario Kart Wii in the past 24 hours,"To preface this, if you didn't already know an ultra shortcut in MKWii is a type of shortcut that works by manipulating key checkpoints to complete a lap by skipping most of the track. You can see a very detailed explanation [here](https://youtu.be/mmJ_LT8bUj0). These shortcuts are only known to be possible on some tracks, and the community is still discovering which ones can be possible and has been doing so for over a decade. So far about half the tracks have an ultra cut.

Anyways, within the past 24 hours, the community discovered 3 new Ultra Shortcuts on the tracks GBA Shy Guy Beach, N64 Bowser's Castle, and the elusive Koopa Cape.

It started with N64 BC, a beautiful TAS-only cut that utilizes a supergrind into a pole clip off of the flagpole to respawn behind the checkpoint. You can see this [here](https://youtu.be/62trxH-akis).

Following that, about 3 hours later an ultra cut was found on Shy Guy beach, which involves doing a clip off of a bomb that just so happens to appear at the beginning of the track after 3 minutes. While this isn't very useful for a normal run, this does at least mean it can be used as a great flap strat. This is also the only one that's RTA viable. See this one [here](https://youtu.be/Mqh7Y-UdfZ4).

And just a few hours ago, a video was uploaded with a working ultra cut for Koopa Cape, a track that was theorized to have an ultra cut for years and would always have ultra cuts ""discovered"" as an april fools joke since forever. This is yet another TAS-only strat as it once again involves a supergrind into a crazy clip, but it is once again very great to see. See this one [here](https://youtu.be/HLKHCGKYVU4).

Anyways, I would just figure I'd share this because I didn't see any mention of it on the subreddit and this is some crazy shit to discover in a single day over 10 years after the game came out. The last time we had this many ultra cuts discovered in such a short time was 2015, and it's exciting to see just how much more things have been broken. I hope you guys all find this as sweet as I did!",mariokart

But in my own experience it is never faster than pointing the stick directly right or left. I can see the benefit to it. I have managed to charge my boost faster on some turns using it, but the only reason I wasn't pushing straight left or right was because it would have slide me off the map. The information I'm finding suggests that there is an ideal slide angle that always charges faster than horizontal, but that just doesn't seem true when I test it.

What beta content do you find most interesting? Which [Mario Kart] game do you think deserves more information regarding pre-release content?,"Like plenty of video games, each Mario Kart game has an interesting story regarding the road to completion. Before release, there may be reveals or leaks about unused or scrapped content that could have deliberately changed the game. While I cannot do anything about it myself, I do want to learn more about them based off what I already know. (I actually wanted to do a post where I summarised what we knew from each game, but it got too messy so I scrapped it. Feel free to check out all the information of each game yourself.)

For me, the first three Mario Kart games have the most interesting stories, and I want to learn more about their journeys to the end. With SMK, you basically get an entirely different game with starkly different assets since there was little material to work with. For MK64, plenty of known and rumoured beta builds exist that we still clamour to find (playable Kamek and two bizarre courses would be worth checking out). Finally, MKSC has far too little to its name regarding beta content to rest. Besides knowing about significantly different builds (like the 2000 build) that still need to be acquired, I have read a few articles that may hint at other things (if what people say about the E3 2001 build is true, there may be a few more courses than what was released).

The later games have their fair shares of spoils too, but by MKWii I stopped really caring about the beta content because it started to become less interesting (even if MK8 originally allowed you to hold items behind you while opening your slot).

Anyway, what beta content do you like and what more would you like to see?",mariokart

I understand the miniturbo stat is the most important and in that regard the GLA tires give no negative penalty while the other two give -0.5. However I also understand that that good traction can help with soft-drifting and the Off-Road tires also having slightly higher acceleration than the GLA. And finally I’ve also seen people mention that the Slim tires are good for online, although I’m not sure why because they have an inferior miniturbo, acceleration, and traction stat to the other two, but they do have higher speed.

I feel like Mario Kart 8/D just doesn’t have that level of chaos and fun as Mario Kart Wii.,[removed],mariokart
[MK] I feel like Mario Kart 8/Deluxe just doesn’t have that level of chaos and fun as Mario Kart Wii.,"In my opinion.

I was playing Mario Kart 8D on my switch yesterday during my train trip (offline Grand Prix with CPUs). I notice that the CPUs all drive together really closely so there’s basically no challenge whatsoever in catching up in a race, even if you give yourself a handicapped setup. They’re so slow, you will always outspeed them.  Nothing interesting really ever happens in the races.

The tracks in Mario Kart 8, too. The nitro courses, a lot of them lack any kind of hazard whatsoever making them extremely dull at heart, a few good examples of this being Sunshine Airport, Water Park, and for the Retro courses, they dumb down the course hazards, like Dry Dry Desert (tornado removed, quicksand pit so weak may as well not be there), Toads Turnpike (road wide, traffic is bare, may as well not be there), Sherbet Land (changing the freezies so they don’t freeze you anymore but instead a light bump), Wario Gold Mine carts (turned from hazard into a boost) goes on.

Mario Kart 8’s items feel nerfed to the extreme, And the new ones aren’t even that much fun. Mushrooms speed boost is about a fraction of what it was in previous games.  Boomerang’s hitbox is way too small for it to be remotely useful particularly online where lag is an issue. Fireflower is too similar. Piranha Plant cannot be disposed of at will (meaning you will likely miss the next item box) and the speed boosts are barely useful. The Starman gives next to no speed boost at all either. Super horn in theory is a good concept, but is way too rare for it to be remotely reliable in first place and even then, same story every time, it will be zapped out of your hand by lightning before you can use it against a blue shell. 

Now let’s flip over and compare to Mario Kart Wii, which I played when I got home that night (also grand prixs against CPUs). 

We have races where the entire 11 racers are nicely spread out along the track, making feel like I’m “competing” and comebacks are satisfying. CPU players actually pose a threat to you, races can be pretty intense and interesting through the  fact that CPUs actually drive fast and the sheer item chaos that goes on. 

The tracks in Mario Kart Wii have heaps of hazards to keep you on your toes avoiding them and makes races a bit more exciting; some examples - Coconut Mall cars, Koopa Cape electric spinners, Moonvidw Highway traffic - avoiding these feels satisfying but also seeing other racers get hit by these is comically funny. There’s none of this in MK8 because clearly people complained “too difficult, I don’t like having to dodge course hazards” so Nintendo listened and dumbed down everything.

Mario Kart Wii’s items are comically overpowered and in turn gives me the laughs and smiles (and memes) from using them. From seeing blue shells send vehicles flying into the air and down (same with bombs) and again, Starman giving you an actual useful speed boost, being forced to make everyone drop their items via POW block, or my favourite of all - getting the Mega Mushroom and squishing people to a squeaking pancake. There is none of this comedy relief in using MK8’s items. 


MK8D is fun it’s in own ways, but for me, MKW is just the true classic Mario Kart.

But now wins are starting to come less frequently and I'm noticing most of the people who are beating me consistently are using light weight or super light builds such as BabyX/Biddy/roller or Yoshi/Scooty/roller...How are those builds so consistently faster than mine and other than switching mains what can I do to get better to push through?,mariokart

[MKWii] Revisiting MKWii after 5 years: just how much has the series changed?,"It's crazy to think that our last (original) Mario Kart came a little over 5 years ago, but it's true. Ever since Mario Kart 8 released, I've played it almost exclusively, aside from a couple MKWii or MKDD tournaments at my university. I've logged over 600 hours across the Wii U and Switch variants of the game in that time, so it's safe to say that I've become accustomed to the feel of the new games. After seeing a post on this subreddit about Moonview Highway's killer flute riffs, I decided to revisit what could be described as the epitome of the series, and man has it been fun. However, MKWii is not a perfect game. A lot has changed in the 11 years since its release, and although not all of it was for the best, I still believe that the series has improved as a whole. 

&amp;#x200B;

What's changed for the worse?

* **Roster:** The first and foremost thing I noticed when booting up the game again was the roster. Sure, MKWii's roster is smaller than MK8's, but it's much more original. Each character feels like it has a distinct personality; nowadays, the Koopalings and reskins like Pink Gold Peach and Tanooki Mario are hogging up nearly a third of the roster in MK8. I'm completely fine with one ""clone"" per character (i.e. Mario/Baby Mario, Bowser/Dry Bowser), but when Peach has four variants, that's where things get out of hand.
* **Items:** A common complaint for the newer entries in the series are the lack of items from older games, such as the Bowser Shell and Mega Mushroom. There is an argument to be made in defense of these absences, being that the game can't have too many items, lest newer players become confused; however, the deletion of items like the POW Block and Thunder Cloud take away from the wackiness and crazy fun of the game. There does seem to be an improvement in this aspect, however, with the release of the Mario Kart Tour beta. The Bowser Shell, Giant Banana, Heart, and Yoshi Egg are all returning; the Boomerang Flower even has better functionality, now spinning in a circle around your kart three times then disappearing, all in one press of a button.
* **Tricks:** Although I enjoy the overall physics of the newer games, the one thing I miss are the over-exaggerated stunts that your racer could pull off in the air. It's something that I didn't know I missed until I was playing the game again. These tricks gave Mario Kart its childlike charm, and while they're still present in the newer games, they're just not the same anymore. And if you don't believe me, then answer me this: would you rather see Waluigi turn towards the camera and kick his leg up in the air, or see Waluigi turn a 720 in his kart midair while oddly distorting his body atop his steering wheel?
* **Track difficulty:** Some of this may be due to the engine of MKWii, but the tracks seemed to be more difficult in the older game when compared to the new installments. From the electric obstacles in Koopa Cape to the daring turn over a cliff in Moonview Highway, MKWii delivered when it came to wacky course design. In the newer games, it seems that the developers have tried to make the racetracks more believable in their environments, and while that does add a new level of immersion to the driver's experience, this takes away from the crazy layouts allowed when designing a course.

&amp;#x200B;

What's changed for the better?

*  **Track creativity:** I think this is an aspect of the game that has constantly improved throughout the games, but I think MK8 is right on the money in this department. As I stated before, each track feels believable in its environment, making every race an experience. Mario Circuit's entire track is held up by wood supports, and Cloudtop Cruise's thundercloud section is held aloft by propellers. Even retro tracks like DS Wario Stadium and DS Tick-Tock Clock are completely reimagined, making them feel new and original. You can tell the team went the extra mile to ensure the best experience.
* **Music:** The quality of the music is bound to improve as new installments are created, but I'm not here to talk about that. It's not the quality of the music, but the quantity: every single course has an original piece of music to accompany it (sure you can argue Mario Kart Stadium being a remix of Mario Circuit, but it's still a different composition). It also helps that new tunes like Electrodrome BOP HARD.
* **Kart customization:** With the addition of kart customization in MK7, I could tell that Nintendo would only improve on the mechanic, and boy did they. There are so many options to choose from it's almost daunting as you prep for the races to come. With a greater focus on the pieces that go into a kart build, this has also led to a far more balanced game compared to that of MKWii, where the Flame Runner and Mach Bike reign supreme.
* **Physics:** Aside from the complaint I had with the trick mechanic in the newer games, the physics in MK8 are by far my favorite in the series. As I was transitioning back to MKWii, I found the drifting to be slippery, and I would often run into walls, stopping my momentum entirely. In MK8, I can \*feel\* when I'm turning, and whenever I bump in walls or other racers, my momentum carries forward while slowing me down, just as I would in real life. This more realistic engine has taken the reliance off of heavy characters for racing as well, as lightweight characters won't bounce near as far off of heavier opponents.

&amp;#x200B;

I love both of these games equally, but for two entirely different reasons. Mario Kart Wii offers that nostalgia, never failing to put a childish grin on my face; I enjoy Mario Kart 8 for its mechanics and immersive gameplay. \*\*\*This is NOT me saying one game is better then the other\*\*\* If you've made it this far, thank you so much for taking the time to read all this word vomit. If you agree or disagree, or have anything new to add, let me know your thoughts down below!",mariokart

[MK8DX] Just an idea for a tournament.,"I’ve been trying to do this tournament in Smash for a while that I’ve called Kart-fests, after Splatoon’s Splatfests. Basically I take a theme, make two teams, and have them battle it out in both the Race and Battle modes for about a week or so to see which team comes out on top.

However, I’ve never really had a good turnout when I attempted it. I just kinda figured no one cared enough about Mario Kart to want to participate, or I just haven’t been targeting the right crowd. 

I want to try doing it again on this subreddit, but first I want to see if anyone here would be interested. If you are, what themes would you like to see? I may use one of your guys’ suggestions for my first one.",mariokart

It's better in tight turn drifting sequences.  It gets to mini turbo faster.  I see why so many people use it.

[MKWii] How much VR do I have to have to stop getting 100cc races all the time?,"So I've started playing Wiimmfi about a week ago, and I'm hovering around the 5000-5500 VR range.

1. More Battle customization. Along with the current options, it would be neat if respawns could be disabled and being able to set the number of total players (doesn’t have to be 6v6, could be 3v3, 9v9, etc).

2. Colorable Toads (use the Toad species rather than *Toad* Toad as a racer). Nintendo has played around with using the species before, especially in Gamecube games. Seeing them playable in MK9 imo is unlikely, but also not impossible.",mariokart

[MK8] My Wii U doesn't seem to like Mario Kart 8 for some reason lol,"So recently I found my Wii U console that I thought I'd lost. I wanted to play Mario Kart 8 really bad because it was my favorite Mario game (besides New Super Mario Bros on the DS) so I hooked it up and grabbed my copy of MK8 that I had sitting on a shelf. I put the disc in and waited, but the console stopped making disc noises after a while. It appeared that the console rejected the disc. I took it out, carefully cleaned it, and put it back in. It accepted it this time. I got to the intro screen, but just as it was about to take me to the menu the console stops making noises again and froze up. I took it out and cleaned it again. Rejected. It took two more tries before the console *FINALLY* grudgingly accepted the disc and took me to the main menu. I set up a VS match and got through the first course without any problems, but after the race was finished and I returned to the course selection screen, It stopped making noises and told me to clean the disc again. I took a really careful look at the disc. It was completely cleaned. No smudges, no scratches, nothing. I didn't do anything, just put it in again. Accepted. Playing the next course, again with no problems, I received the same error again and after repeating the process decided to quit out of frustration.

The issue is that it displays an error when I first start up the game and after every course I play. I can make the error go away by removing the Mario Kart 8 disc and putting it back in, but I want to know if I can make the problem go away for good. The warranty on the disc is expired, but I don't want to go get another one because it costs 60 dollars. Any suggestions?",mariokart

The thing is though, I love online since it gives me some kind of interaction with others. When I play though, it is very rare that I ever win a race and still pretty rare to do decent.

[MKW] This is not a joke.,[removed],mariokart
"Do you think [Mario Kart 7] could have used its dual screen and touchscreen more efficiently, especially compared to [Mario Kart DS]?","My opinion of MK7 is not particularly high. It certainly is not my least favourite game in the series, but not too much about the game excites me. It feels like some sort of curse: try not to do anything wrong, but to pay the price it cannot do anything particularly memorable. MK7 is not so much a game with a mix of good and bad qualities the way the other games are. Instead, it is more level in quality...which does not really give it that much strength to hold its own. Maybe it has to do with the limited time the developers had. Even with Retro Studios handling half the courses to speed up production, it does feel rushed. To be clear, I like it but it lacks quite a bit to make itself a notable entry in the series.

One element that felt...just there was the fact that it was on a system based heavily on the DS. MKDS made some interesting use of the dual screen and touchscreen that came with the system in many different ways, so naturally I expected MK7 to have that and more. Well...it seems to be more of a step backwards in that regard.

In MKDS the dual screen could be used to access menus and watch the race from the map below. The map could be viewed in two ways: an enlarged mini-map and a zoomed-in map that tracks where you are on the track in relation to the obstacles and items. You also get to see the placement of all the characters along with their items. In MK7...this is still the same thing. You do have a better view of how items are being used thanks to better graphics, but other than that it is basically the same. I know the phrase"" never fix what is not broken"" is a worthy argument, but they should have at least considered doing something new. One thing I would have wanted to see was a heavier reliance on the bottom screen for navigation, at least for one track. SNES Koopa Beach 2 seems like a track that benefitted from a dual screen in MKDS with its deep waters, so why not have MK7 go further with an optional secret of some sort that puts dual screen navigation to good use? That certainly would have made it feel like something at least.

Touchscreen in MKDS actually did more than navigate menus; it also allowed for an emblem editor. This feature is apparently absent in MK7. It is a bit of a bummer, although I could assume the omission of the feature has more to do with avoiding people making inappropriate emblems on their karts and getting away with it (reporting inappropriate emblems on a stronger online system than MKDS sounds harder than reporting a Stalin Mii, which is easy to spot in comparison). On top of that, the touchscreen simply should have had more integration into the game in general. Not in actual racing of course, but for more optional content like a set of kart-themed minigames perhaps (akin to missions, I guess) such as swiping to throw shells in a specific direction.

While these are nowhere near the top of my list regarding how I would change MK7, these two aspects of the system being underused for the game nags me quite a bit. For a game on a system like the 3DS, there should have been more parallels with what the DS entry did (although not everything needed to be included, like the microphone). I cannot tell if they actively decided against it or they were hard-pressed for time, but either way it is a small thing that does bother me.

What do you think about this?",mariokart

Mario Kart 9 E3 Announcement (Obviously Fan-Made),[removed],mariokart
Mario Kart 9 “E3 Showcase” (FaKe) (OBvIoUsLy) [MKT],"-New Mario Kart game announced to be called “Mario Kart Blitz”

-New mechanic called the “Blitz Bar” replaces function of coins.  As you hit opponents with items or use fully charged up drifts, your Blitz Bar will fill up. The more charged up the Blitz Bar is the higher the players maximum speed will be.

The Blitz Bar also has three lines separating it into sections. By double tapping the drift button the player will enter “Blitz Mode”. 

If the first Bar is filled up the player will receive  a short boost which will have a similar speed boost to the triple mushroom.

If the second Bar is filled when Blitz Mode is activated the player will receive a much more substantial boost, and will receive minimal stun when hit by an item, this stage also lasts longer.

If the third Bar is filled up when the player activated Blitz Mode, the player will gain a boost similar to the golden mushroom, and will gain temporary invulnerability.

When the player activates Blitz Mode it will take away the Bar they currently have full, therefore decreasing maximum speed.

Getting hit by items, or falling off of the track will decrease the amount of boost you currently have in the Blitz Bar (with falling off the track decreasing it more greatly), encouraging players to use their Blitz before they lose it.

-Battle Modes

New battle mode called “Blitz Ball” is announced.

The mode is a mix between capture the flag and (American) football, in which two teams of 6 must take a ball to the other teams “endZone”

At the beginning of the game both teams will have 15 seconds to go the the center of the map before the ball spawns. 

After the ball spawns either team can run into it to pick it up.

If the player with the ball if hit with an item (or special Blitz Ball, Blitz Mode) (discussed later) they will throw the ball up in the air in whatever direction they are moving in, so if a player if moving forward when they are hit, the ball will fly forward.

The Blitz Bar works the same way in this mode, with the only difference being that drifting charges the Bar up much less, and damaging opponents charges it much more.

In this mode when Blitz Mode has a activated with one bar full, the player will lunge forward a short amount, stunning, and knocking the ball out of the hands of, any opponent they touch.

If two bats are full when Blitz Mode is activated the player will preform a longer lasting version of the 1 Bar attack, with more ability to control where you move

If 3 bars are full when Blitz Mode is activated the player will gain a short period of enhanced speed and full ability to control where they move, with the previously mentioned stunning ability.

A player with the ball can use a small amount of Blitz Energy out of their Blitz Bar to pass the ball to a teammate.  The ball will home into teammates similarly to a red shell, but can be intercepted by the enemy, or another teammate.

The game ends when either 3 goals are scored if the time limit of 6 minutes is reached.

-Challenge Mode

New mode announced simply called “Challenge Mode”

Some examples of challenges that are shown are completing a race backwards (with out the accelerate button) as well as winning a 1 v 2 game of Blitz Ball

Each challenge has various levels of difficulty that reward you different medals (which will be touched on later)

For instance completing a race in 3 minutes might get you a bronze metal, while beating it in 1 might get you a gold medal.

Each challenge has 4 medals, with 3 (Gold, Silver, and Bronze) having visible requirements, with the fourth medal (Platinum) having hidden requirements that are much more difficult.

Every week new challenges are released, each with unique challenges and requirements.  

In addition every other week there will be a “Diamond Challenge”. These challenges are extremely difficult and reward the player with a Diamond medal when completed.

-Online Ranking

Super Mario Kart Blitz will feature a new online ranking system, and leaderboard

There will be 3 online leaderboards, one for online races, one for Challenge Mode, and one for battle mode, which will have a special subsection for Blitz Ball.

Each leaderboard will be reset every 4 weeks, alongside the release of a new Diamond Challenge for Challenge Mode, a brand new course set for online race mode, and a new map set/new game mode for Challenge Mode, and new map sets for Blitz Ball.

Ranking for Challenge Mode: Ranking in Challenge Mode will be based off of the amount of medals collected during the season. Bronze metals give you 1 BP (Blitz Point), Silver Medals give you 3 BP, Gold medals give you 5 BP, Platinum Medals give you 15 BP, and Diamond medals give you 100 BP.

Ranking for Online Races: After a race you will gain or lose BP based on an equation that is different per rank. At rank 1 the equation is: players you finished better than - players you finished worse than. So if you finished 4th out of 12 the equation is: 8-3=5 so you gain 5 BP.

 Ranking for Battle Mode: Ranking system will be very similar to Online Races

Ranking for Blitz Ball: A mix of team performance, personal performance, and opponent rank will decide how much BP is rewarded.

Rewards: A certain number of players at the top of each leader board will get a reward at the end of each 4 week season, such as new characters, skins, carts, and cart accessories.

Seasons: Seasons are defined in sections of 4 weeks. During the course of a season there will be 2 diamond challenges released, with one of them marking the start of the season.  

During the season there will still be multiple updates to keep the season fresh, but a majority of new content and balancing will take place at the start of the new season.

Note, seasons won’t be numbered but rather represented by icons, such as a lightning bolt.

If you read through all of this, thanks 😁.

[MK8D] Does this game have a boost/rubber banding for players? (and other question helping me find a strategy),"So, I am about to take part in a local MK8D tournament. Since the rules include ""no items"" and ""standard kart/wheels/glider"" I am trying to figure out what a good strategy would be. 

Basically it seems to me that the character selection is the most crucial part here as that one is not limited.

From what I can gather, despite the character selection being quite big, it basically just consists of three classes: Light (Toad, Shy Guy etc.), medium (Mario, Peach etc.) and heavy (Bowser, DK). Is this correct? Or is there further distinction between the characters of each class? Is Metal/Gold Mario special in regards to stats?

How much faster are heavy characters compared to light ones? 

Also, does the ""chasing"" player get some sort of boost/rubber banding effect? I am not yet sure if it will be 1v1 or if it will include CPU enemies so if there's a difference between vs. Mode and GP mode, I'd like to know, too.

Green Shells and Artificial Balance [Mario Kart 8 Deluxe],"Amongst other forced behaviour is this game that is *meant* to appear ""random"", what the fuck is up with green shells **always** managing to bounce off some magical angle so it hits directly into you?  Even if it has already gone past you with a super fast forward momentum, it WILL find a way to hit you.

Honestly, this is just laziness from the game designers to be forcing this kind of artificial balance.  It only serves to rifen the whole game with RNG so much that it's no longer worth playing.  Might as well just flip a coin instead.",mariokart

Now dont get me wrong I love the game. I have clocked in over 500 hours on my switch in the last 2 years and a good 800 hundred on the Wii u in the 3 years before that.

Ideas for expanding on the multiple-racers-in-a-vehicle mechanic from [Mario Kart Double Dash]: separate screens and flexible player count.,"Quite some time ago, [I stated that the idea that people who want the “Double Dash” mechanic back as some kind of standalone mode was a legitimately problematic one](https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/8y2a1s/a_new_double_dash_mode_for_mario_kart_may_not_be/). It would feel like a deliberate shoe-in, since all you really did was stuff every possible component from one game into a small area of a fundamentally different game. It was, as I said then, lazy and arbitrary of an idea. It also bore too much resemblance to the game it took from to really be justified. Not that I do not want it back--I do, just with some sheer overhauls.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, back then I was only criticising the idea of keeping it the same. But I never really gave my own ideas beyond the fact that the developers publicly stated to being open to “two or even three” characters per vehicle. So recently I thought some more about it and came up with an idea based around the character increase--as well as something new entirely.

*Note that this is not really a concrete or fleshed out idea, as there are many fundamental aspects left to consider like physics and balance. This is all for the sake of bouncing ideas off everyone here.*

So what did I come up with? Well, two broad things specifically:

**An option where each player gets a separate screen**

When I reflected upon Double Dash recently, I recalled how much it bothered me that the gunner seemed limited in scope and options. Then I considered if being restricted to the same screen as the driver may have had something to do with it. In the original game, up to two players could control a single kart. One drove the kart, while the other provided a lot of secondary actions (attacking with items, attacking physically, triggering speed boosts from drifting along with the well-known “double dash” boost). But the driver may have had too much control in comparison. While the idea of a gunner made sense in theory, the execution was too compact for it to really work. A lack of a rearview camera (which was originally intended for the game, I know) made item use more complicated, especially since you could not circle items around your kart unlike the last two games. I also distinctly wonder if legitimately aiming items before using them could have been even more helpful, at least for the advanced players. It would at least allow tossing items to the side, which could have its perks with things like bananas.

But how do you allow for more freedom with the gunner, especially beyond what I just listed (because there could be more to being a backseat driver than just that)? May I suggest multiple devices as an option? Basically the LAN-mode of MKDD, but instead of separate vehicles on each screen you have separate players. This could allow for plenty of leeway for each player to do his/her part and not worry about bogging other players down.

I mention this as a potential option because I see two glaring flaws overall. Firstly, separating the driving to separate devices could interrupt the co-op synergy of the players. Now, to be fair, Super Mario Maker 2 has a similar mode where the idea technically works, but SMM2 also allows for plenty of room for error on pretty much every stage. With Mario Kart, you basically have one chance to make it work with your partner(s), and if you all fail on a course because you fail to communicate your actions well, that may as well be a problem.

Secondly, the actual layout of co-op being this deep and requiring separate devices to play efficiently, although without full guarantee, is a complete oddity. Think of it this way: you can have the more complicated play on separate devices but with deeper mechanics. Or why not do the more convenient thing and put a stripped down idea on the same device? The idea is basically a double edged sword: you could have a stripped down version on one device and the real deal on multiple, but if the fact of the matter is that multiplayer is easy to do on one device then there is no real need for multiple (although again, SMM2 and its multiplayer approaches could indeed be a model to making it work); on the other hand, excluding it to LAN-play would be problematic for those who just want to play it but lack the kind of access necessary (think Toad’s Rec Room in Super Mario Party, for instance).

Also, to be fair, this does require a separate mode and I was not really a fan of that to begin with. But that was moreso because I was thinking about a format unchanged from the base game being basically ported instead. Technically a separate mode could work--it just needs plenty of finesse.

**Up to four racers per vehicle, with varying vehicle and character counts per race**

This was an idea I had since I noticed people wanting this mode back: why settle for only races with two characters per vehicle? Why not mix it up? I mean that in two ways: why not expand to include three or even four players per vehicle, for the sake of local play (yes, I know this is contrary to my last idea but that was a separate idea), and why not mix up the formats to allow for all kinds in each race?

Picture this: Mario races by in his kart, when he suddenly sees Wario and Waluigi on a two-man kart whiz by. At that moment, three different-coloured Yoshis zip by on an ATV, followed closely by a bike carrying Peach, Daisy, Rosalina, and (presumably) Pauline. All vehicle types (or not--bikes with four racers could be too much) can be allowed. In a race, you can interact with so many characters at a time just with such a setup.

But how do you keep it balanced? Ignore how four players on a vehicle could control against one racer--actually think about how many racers and vehicles there should even be. I have a proposal myself.

* Limit the maximum number of characters to 16. This can allow for a potential vehicle minimum of 4 and a maximum of 16, given the different organisations possible.
* Limit the minimum number of characters to 8, although whether having two vehicles in a race is a good idea is best left for discussion. It certainly allows for more classical-style races if playing in single karts.
* For general races, allow the number of racers in a given race set to be determined randomly. For example, in one Grand Prix have a total of thirteen characters riding in nine vehicles (two doubles, one triple, rest single); in another have eight characters in five vehicles (all single save a foursome); in yet another have sixteen spread out over ten vehicles (six double, the other four single). With fundamental differences implemented properly, this could make every race feel unique and intense without getting quite repetitive.
* For online play, only restrict each controlled character to local play--no online users should share vehicles with each other.

Another thing worth noting in general is that this idea relies largely on how many people are playing locally. If only one person plays, then s/he should have access to only single karts. For each player added, additional options are introduced--either team up on a vehicle or go against each other. This might even be able to optionally extend beyond local four player and even up to eight on 2-4 vehicles (assuming this is a Switch or Switch-esque game).

This idea is a lot more solid than the first one, but it is still pretty flawed without taking the actual mechanics of the idea into account. However, I will leave that for another time. So even with the potential flaws, what do you think?",mariokart

[MK] Speculation: Retro Studios' persistent absence of a new game(s) is partly because they have a great role in the development of the next Mario Kart.,"Whatever Retro has been working on ever since they released DKC: Tropical Freeze has been a mystery, with only supporting roles in games such as Breath of the Wild, the software part of LABO (rumoured), and the port of Tropical Freeze being confirmed.

I think this could very well be that they are assisting Nintendo in developing a new Mario Kart to an even greater extent than they have before. They also helped make Mario Kart 7 (and 8?), and are in general a fantastic studio seemingly both in creating their own games and helping out Nintendo. 

With this trust to them and inherent integrity, I can imagine that after the gigantic package that is MK8DX, Nintendo looked to Retro for some exterior assistance and ideas for innovating and improving the franchise to possibly move it forward. They would obviously accept this and being occupied with such a big responsibility plus now also having to develop Metroid Prime 4, that has delayed/slowed down any prior projects (if there are any).",mariokart

\-More challenging tracks. MK8's Rainbow Road in particular was a big disappointment when compared to its SNES, GCN and Wii variations. MK8 has the easiest tracks of any game so far.

\-Bring back the faster gameplay of MK64. It's gotten too slow since MKWii in my opinion and it's especially noticeable when you play a classic N64 track. It takes a lot more time to do a lap than it did in the original game.

\-You should be able to fall off the course without getting placed back on immediately. They should let us mess up without the game fixing it for us right off the bat.

\-Fewer clone characters. Surely we don't need five baby characters right? Baby Daisy and Rosalina don't even exist in the storyline. They were made up for MK8 just to throw in two more babies.

New item idea for [Mario Kart] 9: the Cyan Shell,"I had an idea today. What if you combined the red shell and the lightning? This is what I thought of:

 A cyan shell acts like a red shell. But, when it hits someone, it will shock the victim and shrink them for 5-10 seconds. I imagine the sprite would look like a red shell, but cyan instead of red, and electricity around it. You would be most likely to get it from an item box in 4th-6th place, with a slight chance at 3rd and 7th place.

 Also, no triple cyan shell, because that would be too powerful.

[MK8DX] Just WHAT is up with 150cc?,"I'm trying to 100% Mariokart 8 Deluxe's Grand Prix. 50cc and 100cc were jokes. But 150cc? I'm just stuck on the Special Cup. Through multiple attempts, I can consistently get through Cloudtop Cruise. Then some AI in Bone-Dry Ruins or Bowser's Castle overtakes me in the last. Heccing. Moment. It's driving me mad. I've used multiple setups, looked at so many tier lists.. and I just can't. Somehow, the AI always seems to hit me in midair, and screw me over. Seriously. It feels like the AI have so much more luck/skill.

But there's one thing I've been wondering about.. Mariokart DS had a luck stat. Is there a possibility that there's a hidden luck stat in 8 Deluxe, similar to the hidden mini turbo stat? Or do I just need an optimized build? Frankly, it feels like I'm just running into a wall over and over again, and it's making me feel like I'm going insane.

Name one thing from every [Mario Kart] game (or at least the ones you know) you want to see in “Mario Kart 9”.,"Sometimes the best way to consider how to really represent all the games of a series into one new game is to look at each game and take your favourite element to implement. It helps that a series like Mario Kart is pretty distinct with each entry in some shape or form, so I am expecting some diverse answers. Also, regarding elements from Mario Kart 8/Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (which I will let you consider separate games if you want), just choose one--the new game could go in a different direction from that, so you can at least consider something worth keeping. Finally, spinoff games are acceptable.

My list:

**Super Mario Kart** \- obstacles in versus (chain chomps in this game)

**Mario Kart 64** \- generic announcer from Japanese ROM announcing menu options and offering congratulations

**Mario Kart Super Circuit** \- changing backgrounds/the boo item hurting your target, not just stealing an item

**Mario Kart Double Dash** \- unlockable battle tracks, I guess (co-op style play should return, but it needs an overhaul far beyond what Double Dash has)

**Mario Kart Arcade GP** \- face camera/different versions of tracks (but with far more dynamic additions than what this game brought, m’kay?)

**Mario Kart DS** \- Emblem Maker

**Mario Kart Arcade GP 2** \- colour commentary is a stretch, but why not?

**Mario Kart Wii** \- Tournaments/Competitions (I would rather have this over Mission Mode)

**Mario Kart 7** \- customisable cups but with more options/tanooki tail as a battle mode exclusive item

**Mario Kart Arcade GP DX** \- tiered drifting (where you see how much charge you have for each tier) but with more depth + third drift tier

**Mario Kart 8** \- MKTV

**Mario Kart 8 Deluxe** \- all the battle modes (and then some)

**Mario Kart Arcade GP VR** \- grabbing visible items off balloons, but keep this a battle mode thing

**Mario Kart Tour** \- giving characters strengths in certain courses",mariokart

Make the next Mario kart a better racing game.,[removed],mariokart
[Mario Kart] Make the next Mario Kart a better game.,"I love the newest Mario kart titles. MK8 and MK8DX are so much fun to play. However...something very obvious is missing. 

The race timer.

That’s right, abandoned at MKWii, the race timer may have been small, but it had great value (especially in MKDS). MK8 and MK8DX are still great fun but have become less about timing and great driving and more about just getting the 1st place every time. You could argue that the timer was abandoned for increasing AI capabilities to bring more action (looking at you Smart Bounce green shells :| ) but I really feel like having the timer would bring back a more competitive and comparable online community and game community in general. 

Which sounds better:

I got 3 stars just by being in the front OR

I got 3 stars by actually being skilled enough to beat the 3 star time threshold. Like the DS version. 

MKDS was hard, the AI were brutal, and each 3 star you got on each cup really felt like a triumph due to having to really know the courses and characters to shave off more time for that win.",mariokart

I’m open to all opinions and thoughts although I do have preferences which are expressed in my own personal build.

My build is:
[Char] Dry Bowser, for his weight/speed stat and better handling ability to his heavyweight counterparts
[Vehicle] Bike, Torn between Master Cycle Zero/ Flame Rider, both have 4/3 top speed/ acceleration stats while Master Cycle Zero has more traction with more weight. They don’t inside drift and I prefer that as my race lines have been more smooth with these bikes versus say Yoshi bike which is inside drifting. Flame Rider seems to have a slightly higher mini turbo so I’ve been favoring it more recently.
[Wheels] Roller. I feel like these are a must because of their innately high handling and mini turbo stats.
[Glider] Hylian Kite due to it’s boost to top speed that rounds out my build but does raise the weight a little.

# I really would like to know from players that actually play this way. Thanks in advance!

**Reason I'm Asking:** Wondering if I can set up a 2v2 online match with bots filling in the other 8 slots. 2 players would be on one Switch and the other 2 players would be on another switch in a different location. Just need to know if it can be done with only two NSO accounts (with Guests) or are four NSO online accounts required.",mariokart

[MK] Ranking Blue Shell’s per mario Kart game,"This list is ranking blue shells from worst to best iterations


8: Mario Kart 64- the blue Shell’s addition in this game turned Mario Kart into the most intense party game ever. But the original blue shell really did need some reworking, it did travel on the ground and it did hit first but it was extremely rare to get the blue shell compared to today. 
7: Mario Kart Super Circuit- basically the same problems the MK64 version had, but it was hard to improve since the gba wasn’t that advanced yet. 
6: Mario Kart 7- it had to return the blue shell to the ground and remove the wings. I don’t understand why this was done because giving the blue shill the wings made it so badass I honestly hate the new blue shell. It also is a lot weaker than before, no longer launches you into the air and instead is just like another red shell. 
5-4: Mario Kart 8/Deluxe- pretty much the same problems as before but now they nerfed the blue shell even farther with the super horn. A great item until you realize it stops blue shells which at that point you will just never use it until that happens. Also stuff like blue shells don’t destroy your items anymore. I really hate how much the blue shell was nerfed in the last two games
3: Mario Kart Double Dash- introduced the flying blue shell and gave it wings which made it look super cool. It would fling you up in the air and was definitely one of the more terrifying items in the game. Blue shell got a huge buff for the Double Dash-Wii games
2. Mario Kart DS- kept the flying blue shell and was just as terrifying as before. It would launch you in the air, same as bob-ombs and when hit it would incinerate your items as well or knock them out of you to spread everywhere. 
1. Mario Kart Wii- This was definitely when blue shells were at their peak. Blue shells were a lot more terrifying, especially with the warning blaring as it comes up behind you. The blue shell in this game is incredibly fast and gets right to the punch rather than meandering it’s time to hit everyone like the Mario Kart 7 and 8 blueshell. It would incerate your items too. It was the last game to have the wings too which really sucks. That was the thing I noticed immediately in Mario Kart 7 and 8 that the blue shell seemed slow and dull. It was pretty disappointing when I realized that it basically did the same delay as like a red shell. So basically a red shell with extra explosion. Mario Kart 8 was great but it’s definitely the easiest of the Mario karts tbh. Nerfing a lot of items really made it easy.",mariokart
Favorite Star Music?,"I would rank it like this

8. SMK, not a lot of people really seem to like this one, and it’s understandable. Very basic, and without a nostalgia factor, it feels bland.
7. Wii, This is an honest OPINION. I know this one is a fan favorite, but it just doesn’t capture the feeling of “yeah, I would drop out of 1st just to hear this” . Coconut mall is still the best music of this game imo.
6. 8, most people think 8 isn’t really special, it’s ok, but not to the level of dropping just to hear it.
5. 7. Where things really start really starting to get good is this one. It sounds like it was made with instruments from kitchen appliances and it sounds weirdly pleasant.
4. Super Circuit. People thought that MKSC was a downgrade from 64 in general, but I found 64’s graphics very cheesy, and preferred this one, it even featured SNES tracks on top of GBA. But I rank this one high because it felt like genuine arcade music.
3. Double Dash. I freaking loved this one. It was the first one I would regularly drop out just to hear.
2. 64. I rank this one so high because of the banjo and “wahu, wa, wa wahu” (you know what I mean!)
1. DS. THE BASSLINE IS JUST ART AND LEGEND.",mariokart

[MMK8DX] Vehichle Combinations (LONG),[removed],mariokart
[MK8DX] Vehicle Combinations (LONG)," 

I've seen a lot of incorrect information being thrown around this sub and a lot of posts asking for advice about this topic. This will primarily focus on 150/200cc combinations for regular races, not time trials. There are a couple of things to understand when choosing your combination. There are 7 stats:

Speed

Acceleration

Handling

Grip/Traction

Drift

Weight

Mini Turbo

If i were to rank the stats in terms of importance, i would put them like this:

Mini Turbo

Grip/Traction

Weight

Handling

Drift

Acceleration

Speed

This may surprise some people to see speed so low, but mini turbos actually boost speed far more, particularly on difficult courses with lots of turns. Secondly it is vital to know that your character is the most important thing. The stats for each character are rated out of 6 points. Each wheel/glider/kart can only boost or reduce stats by up to +/- 1.25 stat points. To see the full list of all stats see this page here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/7m9yyx/mk8dx\_all\_characters\_vehicles\_tires\_and\_gliders/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/7m9yyx/mk8dx_all_characters_vehicles_tires_and_gliders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

For help seeing the stats of your combo I use this website and have so far found it excellent.

[https://www.mk8dxbuilder.com/](https://www.mk8dxbuilder.com/)

For building the ideal combination i would recommend a large character in a vehicle combination with high stats in those which are most important.

However it is important that you feel comfortable with what you are using. Play with different combos and get to know what you like, and what you think is important.",mariokart

[MK8DX] What is the easiest staff ghost you have raced against? (150cc AND 200cc),"Since many people are talking about hard staff ghosts, I decided to try and flip this around and instead talk about the easy ones!  
Here's mine:

**150cc: Super Bell Subway**

Watching the replay is painful. The ghost barely drifted more than once on the first lap. Nin★Juliet's build sucks, and a simple drift puts her down. I beat her by about 15 seconds.

**200cc: Dry Dry Desert**

Again, Nin★Chris's kart was garbage. He flipped the meta on its head and took Lemmy/Tanooki Kart/Off-Road/Super Glider into the god tier track. He likes to drift in the middle and not at all abuse 200cc and treat it like 150cc. This guy also tricks on the oasis. Enough said.

"[MKDS] Snaking, good or bad?","[MKDS] This installment, arguably, has something in common with Melee, and that’s that “it’s brokenness makes it better” and with that we discuss the 4 karts that everyone who ever played this game for longer than 69 minutes uses the most. The ROBBLS Dry Bomber Poltergust and Egg (I used the Dry Bomber because it was the smoothest, even if it was slow) and these 4 karts have one thing in common. Snaking. If you’re an MK8(D) pleb I’ll quickly explain what it is. Basically the Drift system in DS would give you blue sparks after you slid the d-pad left to right once at high speeds, the blue sparks don’t boost (I might be wrong, but orange snaking is easier)  if you slid the d-pad twice, you got orange sparks. In MK8(D) it’s timed and in MK8 specifically there was the whole “mini turbo fire-hop extension” thing.  So what people would do is slide the d-pad really fast to get turbos really fast. So fast in fact that you could do it on straightaways. How good you were was defined by the narrowest straightaway you could Snake on. It made DS, like Melee, attractive even to this day to people who are competitive, but alienating to people who just wanted a good time. Was this a good thing or a bad thing (I think back then it was a bad thing but now it’s a choice to play DS with wiimmfi, so it’s a good thing now because casuals pivot to MK8(D)) MKDS isn’t as complicated as Melee, but the only installment that was arguably more complicated than DS was Wii.",mariokart

Pros:
GREAT Graphics (honestly any YouTube video or online video you see only isn't do it justice, Toad Circuit has never looked better!)
Smooth Controls (Pretty easy to manuever after learning the basics, easy to select items and a quick swipe back or forward puts to item in the way you want)
Reward System (There's a pretty easy level up system and the more you play, the more races you unlock)


Cons:
Lag, somewhat? (Honestly there wasn't anything dealbreaking, but considering I'm from the U.S. and the players I versed in my second race we're all from across the world, I felt it slow, at times)

Item Optimization (I'm pretty sure I got a bomb in first place 🤣 so that might have to be adjusted slightly)

Peripheral view (don't know if it's my phone screen, or the way the game layout is, but at times it was hard to see where to turn next at times?)

[MKT] Something unfortunate I noticed,"It plays pretty great, although there is something I noticed (not sure if it'll be like this in the final version), you don't actually race against people real time, you race their AI. All the people you see are most likely matched due to them also doing that specific course at the same time, and you race against their character, kart, and glider selections.  It's easy to tell based on the beginning and ending of races. If you skip the intro the race starts instantly (if there were people, you'd most likely have to wait a little unless everyone skips), and when you finish a race, the results pop up in less than 3 seconds all at the same time even though there are people clearly still racing. It's still fun regardless, but keep these in mind when playing.",mariokart

Mario Kart Tour Frequently Asked Questions,[removed],mariokart
[Mario Kart Tour] FAQ," 

Hey there. Here's a few answers to questions that will surely be asked in the coming days. Adding as I get asked things.

Can I download the APK? No. Presently the game must be gotten through Google play using a beta approved account.

Controls? You can swipe to steer and enable gyro in the setting. Gyro feels wonky to me.

Can I play landscape? Nope, this game is intended for vertically held, one handed play. No flipping.

Is there multiplayer? Sadly it doesn't look like it. There is no mention anywhere in the game about playing with/against other people live. All opponents are clearly bots using other peoples names. Maybe this will change later but for now, expect a single player Mario kart game.

NO MULTIPLAYER?! Well okay there are what's called ""Ranked Cups"" where you try to get the highest rank possible. It's leader boards. So there's that I guess.

Fps? It will surely depend on your phone but it runs at a smooth 60 on a glaxy s8+. The game seems to be using mk7 assets but it is dang smooth.

Will beta data carry over? NO. In the news section of the beta it details that with no exception all beta data will be wiped.",mariokart

I just got the Mario Kart Tour Beta,This game has the worst controls you could possibly imagine in a racing game. I truly do not know what Nintendo was thinking. You play a racing game...in portrait. You slide your finger left and right across the screen to steer and it's incredibly awkward. Why is this game not in landscape? Why not have a gyroscope to turn and have a drift and shoot button for your thumbs on the screen? Have any of them ever played mario kart before?,mariokart

[MKT] First impressions,"The game is certianly fun, but I have a few gripes with it, it's got a very lootbox kind of system for getting characters, karts and gliders, and the controls are kinda finicky (Don't know how many times i accidentally used an item). And players are given distinct advantages based on what parts they use. Characters effect how many items you can hold, karts effect max speed, and gliders effect how good your items are. It creates a bit of an unbalanced system.",mariokart

[MKT] Funky Kong in Mario Kart Tour,"So in the survey for Mario Kart Tour you are asked what Mario character you like, most likely so they know who to cut and who to keep. There is an option at the bottom, however, where you can just fill in any Mario character you want. You should probably see where I'm going with this.",mariokart
"[MKT] Great Game, Very Lame. (SPOILERS)","Mario Kart Tour is very cool. I like playing MK whenever I want, anywhere. The character roster is cool, despite the fact that it's missing Diddy Kong and Bowser Jr. There are tons of gliders and vehicles, and many vehicles are old ones, like the Egg 1, Mushmellow, and Super Blooper. The items are cool (OH YEAH MEGA MUSHROOM!) I don't even mind that sometimes the controls are bad. But one thing makes it super lame...

The tracks.

""Old tracks with a new look!""

Literally only 1 track actually looks new, Choco Mountain. All the other tracks are ones that appear in Mario Kart 7. Alot of the game is based on MK7. Very lazy. After 2 cups, many tracks are reused in cups. And there are no retro tracks from GBA, Wii, or Wii U in the entire game! Ugh... 

I hope this is fixed in the final game...",mariokart

How I would change Mario Kart Tour,[removed],mariokart
[MKT] What I Would Change,"This is just my opinion on what changes would make Mario Kart Tour a better game. If you agree, disagree, or just have something to have, I would be very interested to hear you opinion. Also, I might be being a bit too ambitious, but why not be a little creative it my wishes for this game

1. Remove the heart system or change it so that it doesn't run out as frequently (likelyhood: 1/10)

2. Make item pulls less luck based by having an individual kart, character, and glider pipe (likelyhood: 2/10)

3. Give triple slots to ALL characters. The main appeal of MarioKart is playing as your favorite Mario character. You shouldn't be forced to play certain characters on certain tracks (likelyhood: 2/10)

4. Have karts give special items and add tires, which would have the kart abilities (likelyhood: 0/10)

5. Add online mode (likelyhood: 9/10)

6. Give ALL characters small advantages AND disadvantages, like have DK have a longer throwing range with bananas but less effect from mushrooms. (likelyhood: 2/10)

7. Remove invincibility from frenzy mode (likelyhood: 4/10)

8. Give options to adjust sensitivity of gyroscope controls and touch controls (likelyhood: 10/10)

9. Give the option to disable steer assist, as it often steers you AWAY from shortcuts (likelyhood: please)

Sorry for the long read :(",mariokart
[MKT] Where's R.O.B.?,R.O.B. was one of the best parts of Mario Kart DS and hasn't been included in any MK game since. MKT would be a great opportunity to bring back R.O.B. as a playable character.,mariokart
[MKT] Hitting Point Walls,"Anyone else struggling the further your progress?

Certain requirements seem oddly high for what is possible (even with perfect combos). I legit had to grind a character/kart/glider plus burn all my tickets just to achieve (barely) a 4* on a single track (3DS Toad Circuit R, Toadette Cup).

Hoping it's a beta thing. I've already found myself drifting into walls to get purple boosts and hitting bananas just to get more offensive items to throw at people. Either the bonus from 150cc needs to be improved or there needs to be some tuning to the individual scores.

Other than that, the game feels alright! I'm adjusting well to the Dynamics and the game feels playable for a beta version.",mariokart

[MK] This Subreddit's Bias For MKWii,"For the entirety of me browsing this subreddit (which is around 3 years) I've seen a strong bias for MKW. Simple posts such as anything about VR or CTGP gets upvoted, anything that's against MKW gets downvoted (for recent example see: tierlists).

As soon as there's something about multiple MKs, you'll see the wii answer being the top comment -- The rest gets either downvoted or just ignored. 

I'm fine with having people on here that prefer MKWii, but that doesn't mean that the voting should reflect that, especially to this degree.

Then there's even the times where there's blatant lies (that get stated as facts) -- Such as MKWii's item system and rubberbanding being good and balanced in Grand Prix (It's not lol), that MKW is the only Kart with a competitive scene (for example check out SMK or MKDD's Time Trialing scenes), and that it has the best features (Technically MK8DX has the most content out of all, although I personally will be preferring MKDS because of mission mode, and all the other modes feeling a lot better to me, but I digress).

I enjoy every Mario Kart, and I have my own preferences, but that doesn't mean I'll downvote just because people disagree.",mariokart

My opinion on Mario Kart Double Dash after revisiting it.,"NOTE: Again, this is MY opinion. I understand if you disagree but if you can't take opinions and just immediately get defensive you need to get off the internet.

(this is when I was very young) Whenever my parents went shopping I would be put in the kids play area just so I had something to do. I would usually go on the provided GameCube and play Mario Kart: Double Dash. I had some good memories of it and decided I would revisit it on my computer (using dolphin emulator and an xbox controller which works well enough for this). 

My experience wasn't that great to say the least. I have played this game for a few hours to get used to the controls and they are just so slippery and clunky! If you are going to say its because because of its my xbox controller then please go away. I am able to handle really well in other games such as Mario Kart 64 and Mario Kart Wii with the same setup. But again the controls in this game are very slippery and are just frustrating to use. The map selection is pretty poor but the maps themselves are pretty nice except for Sherbet Land, that track is just irritating and is my least favorite. My favorite is Baby Park just because its so fun to race in. 

The kart designs just don't look good in my opinion (also a very poor selection too compared to other games like mario kart wii). They honestly look very ugly and just way too big although I can understand why because there are 2 players on each kart. The item selection is good although I just dislike the star theme. The music is also very catchy too, I like it.

&amp;#x200B;

My overall rating of the game after revisiting is probably around 5.8/10.",mariokart

"[Mario Kart Tour] Guide for the challenge ""Take out a total of 10 pipes during a race.""","If you're far into the game, you might notice that you've still made almost no progress towards the pipe badge. But there's actually a way to get it reasonably quickly.

1. Select SNES Mario Circuit 1
2. Choose a character with 3 items (or 2, if you don't have any, but it'll be harder)
3. Choose the lowest speed vehicle (this is important for sandbagging)
4. Choose a ++ item luck glider (this increases the chance that we get the item we want)
5. Choose 50cc (easier to hit pipes this way)
6. Start, and hold down the accelerator during the countdown so you burn out. 
7. Drift in the opposite direction of the track until you're in 6th or 7th place, and try to stay there. It's hard, so do your best to drive as poorly as you can. Make sure you never get sparks, and hop as much as possible.
8. Immediately use all items except for Mega Mushrooms.
9. Once you get a mega, disable auto items in the settings menu. 10. Wait for the section of the track where there's two pipes on the right half of the track, and run over them. If executed perfectly, you can hit 3 pipes with one mega.
11. Repeat. This will probably take six tries, depending on your luck with items.

This is really helpful if you are low on stars, or just want a badge not many people have. Bonus points for using Baby Mario, since you can also unlock the 200 coins with a baby driver badge.",mariokart

I got this exact frenzy on GCN Dino Dino Jungle just a few nights ago, and by the end of the race, I had scored well over 9000 points.  In fact, on the ranked cup where I got that score, I was so far ahead of everyone in the league, that if you were to take that score away, I would have still been in the lead by a good margin.

[Mario Kart 7] Neo Bowser City Super Mini Turbo,"For any Mario Kart 7 experts out there, I have a question that I have been wondering for quite some time now. In the track Neo Bowser City, there is one specific turn on the curving covered bridge that appears to be unable to support a super mini turbo, not matter how long a drift is held. It may be possible to perform a super mini turbo while going around this turn, but in all the time I have played the game, I have never managed to squeak one out, even holding a drift long enough to bump into the left wall. This does not appear to be the case in the Mario Kart 8 version of this track as it takes little to no effort to perform a super mini turbo. I am unsure as to whether this is a glitch or not, so I figured Reddit would know. In the video below, you can see the turn I am talking about at about 0:36

[MKT] I think I found a solution to the frenzy mode problem and would appreciate some feedback from y'all despite me not being part of the MKT dev team.,"Over the past week, some of us were lucky enough to have played the closed beta of Mario Kart Tour.  That said, there is one mechanic that is straight up broken.  Item Frenzies are a constantly looming threat in EVERY race.  All it would take to steal a win is a single Frenzy and tracks determine who can do this by way of having some racers use 1-3 Item slots.  The characters that can use 3 slots will vary WILDLY from one track to the next.  I believe I have found a way to solve the problem.  Bare with me here as I just came up with this mere minutes before typing this all out.  In a single frenzy, there is a MASSIVE window of opportunity for item spamming.  In fact, its very overwhelming not only because of the invincibility and item spam, but most of all, its duration.  If the duration of the Item Frenzy were to be reduced to say, about half of how long it is in the current build of the game, maybe it would result in a more balanced race.  I fully accept the possibility that I could be wrong about this and would very much like to see what y'all think of my idea.  Thanks in advance for any and all the feedback that you provide me with.",mariokart

[MK8DX] How to get good at Tilt Steering?,"So while I was at walmart looking for a travel case for my switch, I spotted some Joy-Con Wheels that were on clearance for like 50% off. I decided ""heck yeah"", purchased them, fired up tilt steering, and gave them a test drive. I swear to god it feels like my Mii driver is drunk. Sometimes I'll tilt the dang wheel 90 degrees and she'll still drive off the track in the other direction. Other times the slighest turn in one direction will cause a sharp turn on the game. Is it worth trying to figure out(and if so, what's the secret?) or should I just try to get my $7 back?",mariokart
[MK] Idea Dump for Next Mario Kart,"As a semi-competitive Mario Kart player who has played every game, no game has impressed me more with it changes than Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart Tour (kinda...) and I feel like the concepts of these games would work well together in future installments in the MK series.

Primarily, the concepts I believe should be brought from the new Mario Kart Tour to the mainline series are the slot-like item roulette and the kart bonuses (ex. longer dash panel boost). Obvious, these will have to be greatly balanced to work with the current kart system, and here is how I would make it work.

First, all characters would have access to the triple roulette on all tracks. Secondly, ""frenzy mode"" would be greatly changed. If you match two items on the roulette, you will receive three instead, so matching 2 mushrooms will give you a triple mushroom and matching 2 green shells gives you a triple shell. If you match 3 items, you will receive a greatly improved version of that powerup and receive a slight speed boost. Here are the possible results
3 coins -&gt; super horn
3 poison mushrooms -&gt; mega mushroom
3 mushrooms -&gt; gold mushroom
3 g. shells -&gt; bowser shell
3 r. shells -&gt; blue shell
3 bananas -&gt; giant banana
3 fake item boxes -&gt; POW block
3 hearts -&gt; boo
3 piranha plants -&gt; chain chomp
3 Bob-ombs-&gt; Bullet Bill
3 fire balls -&gt; fire flower
3 super leafs -&gt; Cape feather
3 bloopers -&gt; lightning

A few items will need to be changed in order to better balance the game
- Fire Balls will only release one fire ball, but they will be able to be greatly influenced
- Fire Flowers will send a cluster of fire in front or behind the player. It can be use 3 times
- Boomerang Flowers only have one use and have a much shorter range
- Bloopers will only affect the one random player
- Super leafs now give a bit more vertical height and will only effect ground items
- Cape Feathers will spin out any nearby players

A few new items will be added as well

Warp Box: Instantly warps you to player in front of you. You have no invincibility frames after exiting.
3 Yoshi Eggs -&gt; warp box

Cappy: Cappy will fly in front of the player and pick up items from the ground or from other players.
3 boomerang flowers -&gt; Cappy

Another change that would be great is a change to vehicles customization. I would change characters, karts, tires, and gliders to purely cosmetic, while changing engine type, axels, and item canisters will effect kart stats. Engines will allow you to change your speed, weight, acceleration, handling, and more just like in Mario Kart 8. Axels will let you pick your own bonus ability. Item canisters will allow you to increase/decrease your chances of getting certain items, like more bananas/less shells. Alternatively, these could make some items stronger than others, like faster green shells/ weaker mushrooms. All matching chances will only change based on placement in a race.",mariokart

"(Hyduken) Super MarioKart Hyper street kart 2019 fix.

Hydukens turned back into turtle shells and the title screen became the stock Super MarioKart which was sad. Now I found the fix and it was easier then I made it out to be when I origonally done it up. Video below for a better understanding. Enjoy this rom. It is 99.9% Fixed Chung Li beacheh used to be totally broken. I fixed it up for 50 cc and 100 cc sadly 150 cc is still problematic on this track and only this track. I keep trying and to fix it. When I get 150 cc working then 50 cc and 100 cc mess up so its either redesign the track or this is as good as it gets. Other then this this hack is polished down to every miniscule issue.

Returning to the game - any help for a running start?,[removed],mariokart
"Time we talk about the failed [Mario Kart] spinoff, Mario Motors.","Being a spinoff of a spinoff is not that surprising for Mario Kart. After all, we have the arcade games. But I have been meaning to talk about some interesting experiments in the Mario Kart universe for awhile and decided to start with a beefy choice for discussion: Mario Motors. While never explicitly stated to be a Mario Kart spinoff, it seems to be implied as such.

Developed for the DS starting in 2005 (well into MKDS development time, if not after the game was finished), [the idea behind the game was that you could design your own motors](https://www.destructoid.com//ul/499705-yoot-saito-worked-on-mario-motors-a-canceled-game-about-building-engines/h3-noscale.jpg), presumably with a list of settings largely controlled with the touchscreen pen. Actually, there is a bit mentioned about considering using the microphone to have children blow into the system to affect the engine's acceleration but was scrapped since it was assumed to ""cause children to get out of breath"". (No worries, folks--the microphone works whether you blow or not.)

I think the idea of the game is pretty impressive in concept. The idea is that you sculpt the engine yourself and account for any features of your engine based on the shape of it. As for why it never went through, the guy who came up with the idea Yoot Saito responded, ""I can't tell you why, but please guess"". I assume being inconvenient and complicated for children might have been the big issue.

The idea of it being a Mario Kart spinoff is a plausible idea, but it brings up a confusing point: if this game was its own thing and made on a console with a Mario Kart game that did not seem to be built for considering data between the two games, was it really something applicable to Mario Kart or was it something else altogether? The idea is an odd one, since we would want to test our engines on the road--possibly against other people's models online. So given the limited information we have, it does make it confusing. Then again, it could purely be designed to be just a game where you built cars.

Could this be revived? Honestly, given the popularity of games like Mario Maker I can see this coming back--maybe as a game within a game in the next Mario Kart. It seems to make more sense to implement than a track creator, at least for now. It also could probably work as something to accompany a Mario Kart game rather than as a standalone thing with no relation to anything whatsoever (seriously, how would the DS have compensated for that?). Would I use it? Likely so, if it was developed well, but my main issue is that it would probably not work in the same vein that the original design was (see lack of reliance on touchscreen for Switch, assuming this is the model Nintendo uses for the future if the game goes to either that or stays on the Switch). I guess I could expect it to be simplified for console-style use...which is fine so long as it is a robust feature.

What do you think about this?

[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe] almost always starts spectating at the very beginning of races,"I've recently began noticing that almost everytime I jump online to play a Worldwide race matchmaking will group me into a race currently in progress. Fine, there's nothing wrong with that, at least there was nothing wrong with it in the past, but now I'm always spectating at the very beginning of the races.

After it reads ""You're spectating. Get ready."" there's a lengthy delay after it shows the players list and the race starts with the players leaving from the start/finish line.

Obviously, I don't want to wait 4-5 minutes to play so I'll continuously quit out of groups maybe 4 or 5 times in a row, each one having me spectate at the very beginning, with hopes that I will luckily get matched with a group that hasn't started yet or one that's actually already in progress.

&amp;#x200B;

The  most Comprehensive fix to date. In the past I attempted to transfer  everything to a fresh rom. The reason for this was Epic edit was unable  to make changes to the game, well you could but once you saved the file  it would break the game by sending you to a blank screen and never  loading. My attempt to transfer everything to the new rom was ok as it  worked but I could not add the title screen or the graphics to the  Hyduken weapons and sadly the podium characters were miss matched. Sure  the game worked but the unpolished look was janky at best. Because I  fixed the battle mode with item placements and out of bounds problems as  well as Zengief lake out of bounds problems I had it set in my mind I  was going to get this fix on a rom that had the Hyper Street kart title  screen is place along with all the others goofs ironed out. That has  been accomplished and here it is.

[MK8DX] Advice for returning to the game,"So back in the day I was very much in to Mario Kart on the N64, followed by being very in to Mario Kart on the Wii, but a long time ago I put down the nun chuck and haven’t returned since.

So has anyone got any advice to get me back in the game with a running start? I mean there’s the relatively obvious drift boosts, jump boosts etc but is there anything else I should be doing. Car/bike selection, wheels, character etc. I’m thinking acceleration &gt; than top speed particularly in the early days.

"So in the next [Mario Kart] game, would you want a _____ creator?","Not too long ago I wrote about Mario Motors, an interesting piece of unfinished media that was designed for DS users to create their own engines for cars. The only way I could see this as relevant is if it were linked to Mario Kart, so I brought up the idea that designing karts could be a new thing for the next game. Afterwards, I wondered “Why stop at karts?”

One request people keep giving for a new Mario Kart game is a “Mario Kart Maker” kind of thing. I know that when MK8 came out five years ago, the developers stated in an interview that trying to make one work for the general public was still a long ways off. Sure, there have been proof-of-concept track creators for other software, including one for Nintendo Labo where you could “drive” to create the track in 3D, but to make something as complex as a Mario Kart track--which requires far more than just a track layout--in 3D especially is no easy feat even now. (A 2D track *could* work, but even with what Epic Edit for SMK can do, it still could come off as intimidating for more casual players. The amount of work to be made for even a simple track is more ambitious than something that can be done in something like Super Mario Maker, at least for now.)

But why does it have to be restricted to only tracks? Sure, creating custom tracks are basically the best thing, at least theoretically, to keep anyone playing a Mario Kart game for a good deal of time. But Mario Kart has more to offer than just tracks. Let me name a few alternatives I have in mind.

* **Mario Motors retooled**. I talked a bit about this already. Besides, it goes with the name Mario *Kart* Maker. You could probably extend it to more than just motors, though. Why not individual car parts like wheels and gliders, too? And why stop at functionality when you could give it your own visual design? Custom colours and decals?
* A lot of people seem to want missions back in some form (if you know me, I prefer MKWii’s take on this), so why not use this to take on the idea of a Mario Kart Maker instead of something massive like a completely new track from scratch? Alongside developers’ weekly challenges, have a hub similar to Mario Maker where you can view and play **custom missions** uploaded by other people. Using already existent tracks, you can allow coin collecting, driving backwards (with developers letting this functionality happen if necessary), driving through gates, breaking crates, racing enemies or other things, defeating enemies and bosses… It could probably make for a special kind of replayability, even if a lot of the inspiration comes directly from Mario Maker. Not sure if it would work well enough in practice, but I hope so.
* **Sound creator**. Probably for horns if you use it enough times...I have no idea where else custom sounds would be appropriate. Not sure how it could work, though, since using only a microphone sounds a bit cheesy. Maybe some preset sound effects could be used too, and you could use your own. This might need to be restricted to local play only, though, if you know what I mean.
* **Emblem creator from MKDS**. That could be a nifty feature...if touchscreen is viable enough to allow it. This could go with the Mario Motors idea.
* This might be a stretch of some sort, but...**custom skins for characters** could be something worth considering. After seeing multiple coloured Shy Guys in MK8 and Yoshi in MKSC and MK8, I do wonder if the idea of *making* your own skins is a given. The part of the character that would need to be skinned would be specified in the editor, and there could probably be a sort of texturing option. One gripe I have, though, is that it might be directly connected to the icons on the minimap as Yoshi and Shy Guy were, so that could restrict characters like Koopa Troopa, whose shell is probably the only thing to skin but is something you almost never see. Curious to hear thoughts on this one. It could probably be debunked if the developers provide the skins on their own, but making skins could still be a possibility. At the very least, it makes for a somewhat plausible alternative to a character creator, which seems extremely unlikely for similar reasons to track creators.
* One thing MK7 allowed you to do in multiplayer was creating your own cup of four tracks and play those with people you met. This concept could probably return as a sort of **track playlist**, perhaps expanded to accompany as many tracks as you want.
* Another potential stretch, but for local multiplayer...a **custom item probability set per player**. Basically, it would allow you to toggle the items you want and do not want for races. But perhaps make it unique for each player? Perhaps player 1 wants to never use coins or mushrooms, while player 2 never wants to use bob-ombs or spiny shells. It basically works as a significant upgrade from what MKWii did with its item settings like normal, aggressive, normal, or off. Presets are probably fine, but some people want to customise what items appear. Now, as for how often? This could be the reason why the developers never implemented it, since a vast number of preset probabilities would have to be programmed. And it seems pretty daunting if the player was given the option to set them, too.

Of course, the appeal of Mario Kart is that it is meant to be accessible to just about anyone. These editors would not have to be in the main spotlight, since people are mainly interested in racing, maybe battling. But these could get quite a bit of support and add a bit of variety to the series (although if you ask me, there needs to be more than just a few editors to really make the next main Mario Kart a worthwhile game coming after MK8D). It could make the game something special, perhaps taking the series in a new direction if it catches on.

So what do you think? Would the next Mario Kart game be better if it had an editor of some kind? (Nothing major, but certainly something.)",mariokart

[MK8DX] Idea for formal FFA tournament rules,"A match will be 12 races, that is a decent amount of races to show who is the best. comebacks are very possible and skilled players can take a match.

&amp;#x200B;

Track picking: Once a track is picked it can't be picked again for the rest of the match. If you choose a track that was already picked you will receive a 5 point penalty.

&amp;#x200B;

Baby park is banned for being way too random and chaotic. anyone who votes baby park will receive a 10 point penalty.

&amp;#x200B;

Random can't be chosen because it could possibly land on baby park. penalty for choosing random is 5 points. 

&amp;#x200B;

Game rules: standard rules will be used, 150cc or 200cc can be used. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone will be randomly be evenly divided into groups. The players in groups must all be the same within 1 digit. example. groups of 5 and groups of 6.

&amp;#x200B;

The top half rounded up will move on, the rest are eliminated. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the next round people will be evenly divided again and things will continue.

&amp;#x200B;

Once there are 12 or less players there will be one final match to decide the winner.

[MK] If the Switch gets more new Mario Kart content would it be a new game or DLC for MK8 Deluxe?,"I think that barring some shakeup to the gameplay (perhaps double dash gameplay again?), I'm not sure there would ever be a good reason for a Mario Kart 9 on the Switch, and not instead just release such new content as DLC for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.  I recall at some Nintendo briefing last year, they floated the idea of releasing more DLC for Breath of the Wild and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and while I'm not expecting BOTW to get more of such content, I can absolutely see the thought process behind continuing to support MK8D in that way.  Especially if other Nintendo games seem to be developing  an ongoing support kind of mentality, as I suspect Smash is going to see even beyond this initial first fighter pass.

I am basically about to buy a Switch. But it's a lot of money and I am having second thoughts. I have been told the online services are not worth getting. My brother had a Switch when online was free and I absolutely loved playing Mario Kart 8 online. So my question is..


Is there a database where I can see statistics about the online Mario Kart 8 community? (e.g. Number of people currently in an online match and the daily peak)


So I can judge for myself how active the game is and so on, since it must have lost a lot of players when the online services became paid.

My Mario Kart Ideas,[removed],mariokart
My [Mario Kart] Ideas,"***My Mario Kart ideas:***

&amp;#x200B;

If there were to be a new Mario Kart, they should make it something like ***Super Smash Bros. Ultimate***. They should get all of the Mario Kart Characters *(excluding Arcade GP)* and maybe add a few characters that fans want, and that make sense to add. I would say around 60 Characters would be a fair amount, since players will have a variety to chose from, but too many will be a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

From time to time, Nintendo should **add more characters**, kind of like how they are doing at the moment in ***Super Smash Bros. Ultimate***. With the character select, they should be put in order of when they were added, like in the game I've mentioned so many times in this post. That would mean players will know who the original characters are (or in slang terms, the OGs), and whose more recent.

&amp;#x200B;

With the images, they should use images that are shaded, kind of like the sample of **Donkey Kong** on the second row. This will make things look cooler, when players are making choices.

&amp;#x200B;

I've decided that like in ***Mario Kart Wii***, **Rosalina** should have a **Luma** flying by her side. I also think **Honey Queen** should have some bees flying with her too! It would be cool to see that.

&amp;#x200B;

They should bring back every single item, but maybe take out the ones people didn't really like. In Battle Mode, they should add more stages, but take out some items from the Battle Mode so that weird things don't happen. With tracks, I don't think they should bring all of them back, but maybe most of them. The ones people enjoy, and all of the classics. They should also make some new ones based on recent Mario Game stages! They should really get creative with the next Mario Kart.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I can't think of much else, you guys can share your opinions. Down below is a sample I made a few hours ago.

[MK] Predicting the Retro Tracks in the Next Mario Kart Game,"I'm a huge fan of retro tracks, and I'm also a huge fan of patterns, so I wanted to take an in depth look at what tracks may be brought back for Mario Kart 9. I know the formula was shaken up when Mario Kart 8 introduced DLC tracks, but I'm just going to look at the potential Shell, Banana, Leaf, and Lightning Cups for the next game.

First off, lets look at some patterns in the Lightning Cup. SNES Rainbow Road appeared as the final track of the cup in MK7, and N64 Rainbow Road held that slot in MK8. It seems reasonable to assume that **GBA Rainbow Road** will end off the Lightning Cup in MK9. Furthermore, in the last three games, the third track of the cup has always been the final track of the Star Cup from two games prior. GCN DK Mountain in MKWii, DS Airship Fortress in MK7, and Wii Grumble Volcano in MK8. This pattern would have **3DS Maka Wuhu** return as the third track of the Lightning Cup in MK9. It also eliminates Mount Wario for contention as a retro track, as it would have to appear in MK10. With this in mind, we have this so far.

Shell Cup | Banana Cup | Leaf Cup | Lightning Cup
---|---|----|----
- | - | - | -
- | - | - | -
- | - | - | 3DS Maka Wuhu
- | - | - | GBA Rainbow Road


Now, you may have noticed that all but one track from Mario Kart 64 have returned. The only track yet to make a reappearance is **N64 Wario Stadium**. By default, it should be set to return in MK9. This will eliminate other Wario tracks (Wario Colosseum, Wario Shipyard) and other stadium tracks (Mario Kart Stadium) from contention. As for the placement of this track, that will be determined after we figure out other returning tracks.

Excusing the GBA versions of the track, there have been a concering lack of Bowser's Castle reappearances. N64 Bowser's Castle returned in MKWii, but the SNES Bowser Castles, GBA Bowser Castle 4, and all Bowser's Castles from MKDD to MK8 are still on the table. Now, there are still four tracks that need to return from MKDD, its Bowser's Castle being one of them. This is where we start to stray from concrete patterns and start to take educated guesses. I predict **GCN Bowser's Castle** to return as the final track of the Leaf Cup in MK9. Why the final track of the Leaf Cup? Well 3DS Maka Wuhu already holds the third track of the Lightning Cup, and Bowser's Castle from MK64 is proof that a Bowser's Castle can serve as the final track of the third cup, so the end of the Leaf Cup seems like the natural choice.

Speaking of reoccurring tracks, let's look at Circuit tracks. Circuit tracks can be fit into two categories: Mario Circuits (including Mario Raceway and the numbered Mario Circuits from Super Mario Kart) and ""Other Circuits"" (including tracks like Royal Raceway, the various Luigi Circuits, Daisy Circuit, and the first track circuits (Figure-8 Circuit, Toad Circuit, etc.)). Since MK7, two circuit tracks have appeared as retro tracks, one Mario Circuit and one other circuit. If this pattern holds true, then for Mario Circuits, we have: SNES Mario Circuit 4, DS Mario Circuit, Wii Mario Circuit, 3DS Mario Circuit and WiiU Mario Circuit. For other circuits, we have: DS Figure-8 Circuit, Wii Luigi Circuit, Wii Daisy Circuit, 3DS Toad Circuit, and WiiU Mario Kart Stadium*.

**Mario Kart Stadium is a stadium track by name, but it fills the same role as the first track circuits so I'm counting it here.*

Starting off with the other circuits, we notice that odd-numbered entries in the series have opened with the oldest available first track circuit. MKDS had SNES Mario Circuit 1 (which is SMKs first track, so it counts as a first track circuit in this case) and MK7 had N64 Luigi Raceway. GBA Peach Circuit and GCN Luigi Circuit both appeared in MKDS, so **DS Figure-8 Circuit** is our next available track. Due to the simplicity of the track, there is really no where else to put it except as the first track of the Shell Cup.

Next, we have the Mario Circuits. If DS Figure-8 Circuit will return, I doubt that DS Mario Circuit will return as well, so we'll eliminate that one. SMK has already had three Mario Circuits return, so I'm going to give priority to other games this time around. That leaves us with Wii Mario Circuit, 3DS Mario Circuit and WiiU Mario Circuit. Wii Mario Circuit, to me at least, is the kind of track that we'll see in the Shell Cup, due to its simple layout. There is already a circuit in the Shell Cup, so we'll eliminate it. We have also never seen a Mario Circuit return in the game following its introduction, which makes me inclined to believe that **3DS Mario Circuit** will be our Mario Circuit in MK9. It will likely appear somewhere in the Banana Cup. Let's look at the updated table:

Shell Cup | Banana Cup | Leaf Cup | Lightning Cup | Cup Not Yet Determined
---|---|----|----|----
DS Figure-8 Circuit | 3DS Mario Circuit* | - | - | N64 Wario Stadium
- | - | - | -
- | - | - | 3DS Maka Wuhu
- | - | GCN Bowser's Castle | GBA Rainbow Road
**Position in cup not yet determined.*

There are a collection of tracks that do not share a name, but they do share a theme. The two most common examples are snow tracks and desert tracks, with one of each appearing as a retro track. Our available snow tracks include: SNES Vanilla Lake 1 &amp; 2, GBA Snow Land, Wii DK Summit, and 3DS Rosalina's Ice World. Remember, WiiU Mount Wario is not available due to the Star-Lighting Cup pattern and the inclusion of N64 Wario Stadium. SMK has had all but two kinds of tracks make an appearance; a Vanilla Lake and a Bowser's Castle have yet to reappear. Since the Bowser's Castle slot is taken, I believe that a Vanilla Lake will finally return after all these years. Additonally, a SMK track has not appeared in the Leaf Cup since MKDS. I believe that we will see a modernized **SNES Vanilla Lake 2**, perhaps with some underwater sections in the middle lake, in MK9. I also believe that this will be the only SMK track to reappear (side note: I do believe there will the 2 GBA tracks, more on this later).

As for the desert tracks, we have: GBA Yoshi Desert, Wii Dry Dry Ruins and WiiU Bone-Dry Dunes. This one is more of a hunch, but I think that **Wii Dry Dry Ruins** will return in the Leaf Cup of MK9, as it has a lot of potential to make use of new mechanics that have since been introduced to the series.

Another reoccurring theme are traffic tracks. Our available traffic tracks are: GCN Mushroom City, DS Shroom Ridge, Wii Moonview Highway, and 3DS Wuhu Loop. WiiU Toad Harbor could fit here, it really isn't on the same level as the other traffic tracks mentioned. I'm going to eliminate 3DS Wuhu Loop because of the inclusion of Maka Wuhu, I don't think both Wuhu tracks will reappear in the same game. MKDD and MKDS are getting short on tracks, and they both already have one returning so far in my predictions, so I'm going to eliminate Mushroom City and Shroom Ridge. That leaves **Wii Moonview Highway**. Where else could Moonview Highway be but the Lightning Cup (which is why I moved Dry Dry Ruins over to the Leaf Cup).

There are still a couple themes we haven't looked at yet. Beach courses are another common type of course. For beach tracks, we have SNES Koopa Beach 1, GBA Cheep Cheep Island, 3DS Cheep Cheep Lagoon, and WiiU Dolphin Shoals. I've already said that I think there will be only one SMK course, which eliminates Koopa Beach 1. I have other predictions of which MK7 and MK8 tracks will return coming up later, and that wouldn't leave room for Dolphin Shoals or Cheep Cheep Lagoon. That leaves **GBA Cheep Cheep Island** as our beach course. I think that this track will find itself in the Banana Cup. It also fills out my prediction of 2 MKSC courses returning.  Now is a good time to say that I think Wario Stadium will find itself in the Banana Cup as the final course.

""Spooky"" courses are another common theme. Available spooky courses include: SNES Ghost Valley 1 &amp; 3, GBA Boo Lake &amp; Broken Pier, and WiiU Twisted Mansion. **WiiU Twisted Mansion** is the clear pick, as I don't feel Nintendo is gonna add more than one SMK track or more than two MKSC tracks. Twisted Mansion would take up a slot in the Banana Cup, filling out the cup. Let's check out the table:

Shell Cup | Banana Cup | Leaf Cup | Lightning Cup
---|---|----|----
DS Figure-8 Circuit | 3DS Mario Circuit | Wii Dry Dry Ruins | -
- | GBA Cheep Cheep Island | SNES Vanilla Lake 2 | Wii Moonview Highway
- | WiiU Twisted Mansion | - | 3DS Maka Wuhu
- | N64 Wario Stadium | GCN Bowser's Castle | GBA Rainbow Road

Five tracks are needed to complete the predictions. The Shell Cup is looking a little weak, so lets look there first. I'm gonna start off by predicting that **Wii Toad's Factory** will return to close out the cup. It's a popular track and doesn't clash with any of the other picks, so I think it's safe to include. As for the other two tracks, the process of elimination tells us that the tracks need to come from MK7 and MK8. Since Cheep Cheep Lagoon is off the table, and Shy Guy Bazaar could only really appear as the final track of the cup in my opinion, **3DS Daisy Hills** will take up the second slot of the Shell Cup. The third slot could be taken by wither Water Park or Sweet Sweet Canyon. However, even numbered games have always had the first cup of their Shell Cup be the second track of the Mushroom Cup from two games prior, with MKWii having GCN Peach Beach and MK8 having Wii Moo Moo Meadows. That would mean MK10's Shell Cup would lead with Water Park, leaving **WiiU Sweet Seeet Canyon** as the third track of MK9's Shell Cup.

As for the final two tracks, we notice that when including retro tracks from the directly previous game, they tend to choose more than just one or two tracks, which means we need a couple more WiiU tracks to close out these predictions. I'm going to hand those two slots over to **WiiU Electrodrome** for the Leaf Cup and **WiiU Cloudtop Cruise** for the Lightning Cup, as the themes of those tracks don't clash with any of our other picks, and from what I can tell, they're well-liked tracks.

Shell Cup | Banana Cup | Leaf Cup | Lightning Cup
---|---|----|----
DS Figure-8 Circuit | 3DS Mario Circuit | Wii Dry Dry Ruins | WiiU Cloudtop Cruise
3DS Daisy Hills | GBA Cheep Cheep Island | SNES Vanilla Lake 2 | Wii Moonview Highway
WiiU Sweet Sweet Canyon | WiiU Twisted Mansion | WiiU Electrodrome | 3DS Maka Wuhu
Wii Toad's Factory | N64 Wario Stadium | GCN Bowser's Castle | GBA Rainbow Road

[MKWii] Is it Worth Getting a New Wii U Gamepad for MKWii?,"Now I know the title sounds stupid, but let me explain. A while back I recently got my Laptop fixed and there was finally a way for me to play MKWii online again. I can’t play on my Wii because it just doesn’t read games anymore and it’s probably aged beyond repair. In the Wii U method there’s a part where you need to go to the internet browser, but the Wii U doesn’t let you access it unless you have your Gamepad (which is stupid imo). Do you guys think it’s worth to get a whole new Gamepad and charger for MKWii wimmifi (and Mario Maker+Splatoon 1 also, I really like those games), or should I just give up and save money?

***Kamek*** \- Everyone's favourite Magikoopa joins the game! He has really high acceleration, and alright speed, but is lightweight, which means he can be bashed into walls easily.

***Hammer Bro.*** \- They have the same stats as Koopa Troopa, but are slightly heavier. You can choose between playing with normal Hammer Bros., Fire Bros., or Boomerang Bros!

***Captain Falcon*** \- Your Captain coming from F-Zero with his intensely high speed, but his handling isn't all that good.

***Mach Rider*** \- Your favourite biker joins Mario Kart! Although he has low speed, his acceleration is really high!

***Excitebiker*** \- Nintendo's number one biker also joins Mario Kart! He has high speed, but his handling isn't very good.

***Crash Bandicoot*** \- Making his debut in a Nintendo Game, Crash Bandicoot is a really fast character.

***Banjo*** \- From Diddy Kong Racing, Banjo has his little feather friend with him while they race. He is a heavyweight, sharing his weight with Rosalina.

Do you think “shell mining” should return to [Mario Kart]?,"In looking at items and item mechanics I enjoyed in previous games and was interested in seeing again, I noticed Mario Kart Super Circuit was the only one that allowed you to mine red and blue/spiny shells. Basically, instead of throwing the shell behind you, you drop it in place and it tracks down the racer that passes it (for the spiny shell, the racer in first must pass it; it is otherwise a purely invincible obstacle until then). Green shells did not have this ability and were merely thrown behind you.

I really liked this mechanic, since it led to strategic use of both shells (moreso the red shell given the sheer rareness of the spiny shell), and I would be interested in seeing it return. But when it comes to red shells, I have my qualms on them getting this treatment.

* Tracking down the first racer that passes with the pinpoint accuracy and speed that the latest red shells have can be a real nuisance. I guess it worked well in MKSC just because their slow speeds meant you could outrun the shells and they always broke at walls/crevices (although whether they were there for you to make an escape was never guaranteed), but with MK8D accuracy and speed it sounds too daunting. How do you tone it down, though? Perhaps give the racer a three-second head start once it passes the red/spiny shell? Or perhaps dial back the accuracy or speed of the mined shell as opposed to thrown ones?
* It would be extremely overpowered with this effect applied to triple red shells. MKSC never actually allowed you to throw triple shells backwards, much like MK64, so it was never a problem there. But with that limitation gone would the idea still be applied to triple reds by default? Or would you just throw the red shells backwards like green shells?
* The setup of item use in this hypothetical game may be more in tune with the latest games, and introducing a gimmick like this to affect lower-placed racers with already high levels of item usage there is probably going to make things messier. I would argue that this is the biggest problem with applying the mining affect to specifically red shells.

That said, the spiny shell might actually benefit from getting this since it can become an arguably more strategic item if the game plays it in its favour. I do think that its durability and design might get in the way of making this effect useful (why not throw it immediately instead), but with the right approach in designing it, it can be less of an item to immediately ditch and more of one to consider whether you ought to drop the shell to catch first place around the same bend or to throw it and catch it right then and there. It could also cause anyone else that touches it just to spin out rather than get nuked.

So basically, I want to see it return for the strategic possibilities, but I can see where the complications lie in bringing it back (especially for the red shell). And I would be perfectly okay if they left it alone, too--I just really like this as a novelty. What do you think?",mariokart
Do you think MK pros are angry all the time?][MK8DX],The way they play aggressively online makes me wonder if they're ever happy.,mariokart
Do you think the “slippery brake” mechanic deserves to return to [Mario Kart]?,"In looking at mechanics from previous games that I enjoyed and was interested in seeing again, one that came to mind was the “slippery brake” mechanic used in Mario Kart 64 and Mario Kart Super Circuit. The mechanic was simple: if you drove straight into a specific obstacle--most notably a banana peel--your kart would quiver before spinning (I say straight because you immediately spin out if you hit it while you are turning). This quiver is actually a brief window of time where you can hit the brakes briefly and save yourself from spinning out. Indication of success is noted with a music note in a speech bubble above you.

I never quite figured out why this minor mechanic never appeared outside those two games. It lends itself as being a sort of skillful evasion of some minor items and maybe a few course obstacles. And it does not seem terribly overpowered, either: remember, the only item in the roulette this worked on was banana peels. Skill and item wise, it does not seem like much of an issue.

What could be the issue in bringing it back, though, is the updated physics of the karts. I guess you could let it work so well in MK64 and MKSC given that the drivers were sprites, but how exactly could this work on 3D models? And on bikes especially? I doubt that the quivering animation would be as evident as the one for the karts. Perhaps it could be something other than quivering--not even visual--but what else could possibly make sense as a warning animation for slipping? It needs to be a subtle cue, one that does not come off as too much of an obvious move and more as a stealthy one. A vibration on the controller? No, Mario Kart has plenty of vibrations already. An auditory cue, perhaps, like the sounds you hear when a spiny shell is coming your way? I can imagine a sort of screeching noise where the brakes can be used to save yourself. Or is such a noise too blatant? I guess that could be the way to go, as I see no better option at the moment.

Anyway, that is how I see it. What do you think? Do you think this mechanic was any good, and would you want to see it return?",mariokart
What was the best way to die in battle mode in the older [Mario Kart] games?,"Before the Wii game changed it to suit online play, battle mode was a last-man-standing-style game during Balloon Battle whenever you had to pop the other racers’ balloons. Each game has a distinct feeling to itself about it, but what I want to look at was what happened when you were eliminated. There were three different ways of going about this.

* You die and nothing else. Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart Double Dash both took this approach. It made sense in SMK given that there were two players battling all the time; can you really imagine a fight from the grave? While I thought it was a weird decision at first to simply end your battle dead in MKDD, it then dawned on me that there was no real useful way for this to work at the time. The approach that MKDS would introduce could have worked, but since MKDD came first and the only available option made no sense for two players controlling one kart...what else could you do? Best if you like fate and keeping it what it is.
* You die and become reincarnated as a bomb kart/bob-omb. Mario Kart 64 and Mario Kart Super Circuit used largely the same idea: highly volatile bombs that rolled around, seeking revenge on other players. And that was it. In MK64, you also were eliminated for good once you blew up (which also could have been over an accident)so it definitely made your second life feel valuable. MKSC, on the other hand, gives you infinite revivals whenever you explode. Given the rather compact stages, this was an understandable move. Best if you like explosions--and, in MK64’s case, dangerous second chances.
* You die and become a ghost. This one definitely had more variety in being used for Mario Kart DS--and Mario Kart 8. It may not be “classic” battle mode, but it counts. With this form of elimination, you were basically under the ghost effect and could pass through everyone once you were eliminated. You could still play along by bringing out items from mid-air to throw into the brawl (and in the case of MKDS, you could even throw an actual item box only in this state--a pretty nifty feature). So long as you had the spirit of battle on your side and you were rooting for someone, this mode is best for you.

I honestly think all of these are cool ideas. I would personally want to see a mode where you combine the bob-omb and ghost effects into the same elimination category and have it as a sort of randomised feature (basically, have a chance for you to come back as a ghost and a chance to come back as a bob-omb). The bomb kart can be merged with the immediate elimination, too, given that that is only a mere second chance and not an infinite respawn kind of thing. If we ever see classic battle mode again (probably offline), have options for both of these hypothetical eliminations. I really want quite a bit of variety in the fight to the death.

For those who have played classic battle mode, what do you guys think?",mariokart

My [Mario Kart Tour] Predictions,"I have been super hyped for Mario Kart Tour, the franchise is one of my favorite.  I've played almost every Mario Kart with the exception of the arcade series, so you know I have experience with Mario Kart.  Mario Kart Tour is coming out possibly in late May early June so I have a few predictions on what might be involved in Mario Kart Tour:

1) 6-8 racers per race:

The mobile phone is powerful, but not quite to console standards, so it's doubtful that Mario Kart Tour will have 12 racers on a track.  My reasoning is that Beach Buggy Racing has about 6 racers per race, and since Nintendo is more powerful than Vector Unit, they'll probably best that 6 racer mark.

2) Choose your own items

This one is more of a wish, but Mario Kart Arcade GP DX allowed racers to choose what items you wanted to take with you to a race so I feel that Mario Kart Tour might go the same route, which would be pretty cool.

3) Miis

Your Nintendo Account might have a mii on it and since Miis have been playable on Mario Kart since Wii, it's clear that Mario Kart Tour won't be any exception.  I will however flip out of this is possible: being able to customize your kart color for your mii exclusively, Mario Kart has never actually fully allow you to change WHAT color kart you want without changing your mii's color, so this one is again, more of a wishlist.

4) Return of the Koopa King

No, not Bowser, I'm talking about the best looking and best kart in Double Dash: the Koopa King.  Seriously, it looks the best, it sounds the best and I want it in Mario Kart Tour so badly!

5) Popularity greater than or equal to Fire Emblem Heroes

Fire Emblem Heroes is currently very popular, as it has an ever expanding cast of characters as well as the META changing all the time, and since most people love Mario Kart, it's clear this game will have a great future ahead of it; assuming it doesn't follow the footsteps of Super Mario Run.

Special cup

So on mkwii I have three stars on everything except mirror special cup. I was doing the best I was ever doing ever. 

I was on lap 3 on rainbow road in first place. In all the previous races I was far in first from the cpu, but on rainbow road not as much. I was in first for 95% of the grand prix. Enough for 3 stars right? Well

You know the section before the finish where the road is turning to the right (on mirror mode) and the road is curved? I got a blue shell warning there. I thought I was okay because I had a mushroom but of course a cpu thought it was a good time to use lightning and 4th or 3rd place had a mega mushroom and passed me out right at the finish line. Haha... kill me",mariokart
[MK] Ideas for next mario kart,"Firstly: NO COINS (Maybe in coin runners but) JUST NO COINS
and when you make items MAKE SURE THEY ARE NOT CRAPPY AND COMMON
and please please PLEASE bring back mission mode!

Ok I got that out of the way now to more stuff

Characters: No more marios. WE HAVE 5 IT’S ENOUGH!!!

Instead of having so many turtles taking up space maybe do a yoshi/ shy guy and have them all like a customisable bowser jr. 

Maybe make coloured/ winged koopa customisations as well!

Brink back funky kong!

Give wario his motorbike suit

Modes: Mission mode and maybe a track editor! Like smash! maybe you can draw the map and then choose the kind of road you want it to have! maybe something for super mario maker! Super mario kart maker! (but then you would have to buy a game to get that) maybe make it dlc for mario kart/ super mario maker 2! nintendo seems obsessed with dlc!

Items: Maybe an ice flower that freezes enemies for a second and they slide like the things in that double dash stage! It can be used to knock people off the stage on a turn but it would be hard to hit them if they are turning

Mega mushroom and fake item boxes

Maybe have the feather but make more use out of it by having a feather cut on every stage

Other things:

Reverse mode: You play the track in reverse and there are special ramps to make it possible

[MK] Mario Kart Ultimate/9 thought,"Recently I’ve thought about with friends what the character roster for the next Mario Kart game would look like Ideally for us. I came up with a cool suggestion that it be like Smash Ultimate in the “Everybody is Here” theme. Every character from every Mario Kart game would be playable.

I also think it would be cool to have a few selectable styles for certain characters. For example: Mario could have an N64 style, Doctor Mario Style, and Cat Mario from MK8DX could be included with them too.

Nintendo could also introduce a bunch of new Super Mario Characters. Some of the ones I would love to see would be Kamek, Chain Chomp, Goomba, Piranha Plant, Pianta, and Nabbit. Every single Kong would have to make an appearance too, which would include the glorious return of Funky Kong. 

Also with they inclusion of Inklings and Animal Crossing characters in MK8DX they could include some 3rd party characters, my first thought being Megaman and maybe Sonic and Doctor Eggman?

For tracks it’d be incredible if they could do every single retro but I think that would be very unrealistic to do. Instead I propose instead of that every single Rainbow road. In this next game there will be 8 “retro” rainbow roads so why not have 2 GPs with 4 in each. They could be unlockable, after 1 starring every single cup on every single cc (including 200).

These things are just fun to think about, respond if you have any other ideas that would be fun to see in the future.",mariokart

What's your least favourite Mario Kart game? [MK],"I'd say Super Circuit. I just didn't enjoy it as much as the others in the series. Not a bad game by any means, but I rarely go back to it compared to the other MK games. I also think it can be really unforgivable at times. It's the MK game I have the most trouble with. I do love the Bowser Castle stages, though. 

Super Mario Kart looks kinda barren nowadays and lacking in variety, but I'd rather go easy on it since it was the first title of the series and I'm not sure if Nintendo expected the Mario Kart series to become the juggernaut it did. While Super Circuit came out after Mario Kart 64, a game that was REALLY fun back in the day, plus MK64 was my first ever Mario Kart game.

Is there a legitimate reason as to why lack of hopping in [Mario Kart Double Dash] is a bad thing or even a dealbreaker for the game?,"Oftentimes when I read what issues people have had when playing Double Dash, one criticism that I never got was the lack of hopping. It was often called some sort of downgrade from the previous games (or just MK64 because that was usually all they knew) and was somehow a dealbreaker for some. It tends to get paired with the inability to hold items behind you as the idea that MKDD is a “dumbed down” Mario Kart game. I can understand people complaining about not holding items behind you, which is a big deal I guess, but...what did hopping ever do for the series exactly to make it a dealbreaker here? The only answer that might seem plausible is just its connection with the physics system...but even then if the bigger issue is just “no hopping” I am dumbfounded.

Thoughts on vehicle classes in MK9? [MK],"First off, this is my first post on r/mariokart so uhhh... hi guys!

Anyway, I was wondering what your guys' thoughts were on new vehicle classes (like karts, bikes, ATVs, etc.), and what they could possibly add to the game. MKWii introduced bikes, and with them came inside drifting and wheelie-ing, one of those still being a prominent mechanic in the newer games. MK8 added ATVs, but they didn't offer anything in ways of mechanics that made them all too different from karts, so they seemed almost pointless outside of an aesthetic difference. Interested in seeing any ideas you guys may have.",mariokart

[MK8DX] Wall Physics,"^(Am I the only one who thinks that walls just don't work in MK8DX? Sometimes you hit them and bounce off crazily at a 90 degree angle, forcing you to stop and turn around, and other times you don'\[t bounce at all and just get stuck to the wall, trying to drive away. There is no consistency either and if one wall bounces you one time, it might not next time.)",mariokart
